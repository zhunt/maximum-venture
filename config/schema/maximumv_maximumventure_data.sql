It plans to counter this through lay-off of 90 staff members and centralizing newsrooms.\r\n\r\nPostmedia has settled circulation in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa. While it will continue publishing two papers, the writing personnel will be brought under one ambit and will plan and orient write-ups for the two papers from there. This is bound to dilute exclusiveness.\r\n\r\nIt all happened last April when Postmedia proceeded to buy 175 dailies and online papers from Quebecor Inc. It was assertively stated that the two papers will have separate entities and even different newsrooms, but the talk of merger has created a stir in media circles and opened doubts about the decision.\r\n\r\nTuesday’s show of rivalry between the Postmedia papers has already washed the company of imminent hope. It is already under a $670 million debt and this is bound to increase more as print adverts have gone down in demand. Yes, the company has taken saving measures and taken economic steps to ensure that they would save $80 dollars by June 2017.\r\n\r\n“I wanted to make sure that both newspapers [in each of the four cities] would continue, and I think we have found the formula which, at least at this point in time, can mean the continuation of those publications,” Paul Godfrey, Postmedia’s president and chief executive officer, said in an interview with The Globe and Mail. “It doesn’t mean that somebody in Toronto will be writing about the Edmonton local council. It’s going to be someone locally. But this is a consolidation of newsrooms.”\r\n\r\nOnline intervention has radically affected the scopes of print media; and print ad rates have gone down considerably. Toronto Star has in fact decided to show 300 employees the door and put the shutters on its major plant in Ontario, Canada.\r\n\r\nPostmedia plans to fire 90 members. It will however give them a decent exit scheme. It will have a singular writing team for its sports articles, working under Bev Wake. This is part of a downward trend in media recruitment across Canada, meaning more people seeking the services of a recruitment agency.\r\n\r\n“It’s another step in a continuation in having fewer and fewer journalists covering stories in this country that’s been going on for the last 10 years,” said Christopher Waddell, an associate professor of journalism at Carleton University. “It means less coverage.”\r\n\r\nThe pathway Postmedia will take is to have writers headed by a single person. The distinction in articles will be through effective rewriting strategies. \r\nPostmedia has suffered the most in Alberta, already under the hammer from oil prices. It has already had to fire 60 people in offices here. It has had to dismiss people as high as Editor-in-Chief and Managing Editors. This means that media recruitment agencies will be working hard to find new placements for the former Post staff.\r\n\r\nThe standing debt that Postmedia is under is borrowed from two different financial enterprises. It has paid $325 million and plans to take the refinance route next year to gain a position of strength.\r\n\r\nPostmedia accept that it has gone down on its announcement of ensuring the strong running of two newspaper streams and different editorial heads last March.

People want to exchange their currency at a rate that is close to the mid-point of those buy and sell rates. This is known as the real exchange rate.\r\n\r\nBanks and other financial institutions typically charge about four percent of the amount being converted.\r\n\r\nTransferWise is a website that is using peer-to-peer money transfer, using the midpoint rate for the two currencies and is charging a fee of about one percent for transfers between $500 and $1,000. The rate drops for larger amount transfers. The fee on a $50,000 transfer would be about 0.72 percent. They are currently improving their setup in Canada and by March would be providing regular service here.\r\n\r\nIf one is exchanging amounts over $5,000, then University of Toronto’s business professor Ambarish Chandra recommends using online currency exchanges. There are websites like CanadianForex, XETrade, and NorthStar. Other companies do the exchange transaction over phone e.g. Knightsbridge Foreign Exchange.\r\n\r\nUsing these services requires that you first setup an account and have bank accounts in both the currencies. It takes six business days to complete the exchange but normally takes about three days.\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have a foreign currency bank account, you can transfer the money to the account of a friend or relative.  \r\n\r\nFor most people on short trips, Chandra recommends using the Credit Card to make purchases in the US and many other countries. Their exchange rates are slightly better than the banks. You can expect to lose 3.5% using your credit card in the U.S and more than four percent in other countries.\r\n\r\nIf you are a frequent traveler then you should get a U.S dollar credit card. The key to saving is how you pay the monthly credit card bill (also check the credit card fees). \r\n\r\nRogers bank offers a credit card through MasterCard that does not charge 2.5% foreign exchange transaction fees and the exchange rate they use for U.S dollars is the Bank of Canada’s mid-market rate.\r\n\r\nOther credit cards that don’t charge a foreign exchange fee include the Marriott Visa and Amazon Visa from Chase Canada.\r\n\r\nA final way to avoid foreign exchange fee is to buy shares in an interlisted company on Canadian stock exchange and then selling those shares on a U.S stock exchange.\r\n\r\nChandra recommends using this method for converting large sums and doing it through an online broker to keep the trade fees low.', 0, 10, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'The Canadian Dollar has fallen one third in comparison with the U.S. Dollar.

Bell Media owns the property where the transmission tower is located.  The only way to access the tower is through an adjacent property. Bell Media had a verbal agreement with the previous neighbour who allowed Bell Media entry to the access road.  However, Bell is now having trouble accessing the transmission tower due to the new owner of the access road.  The new owner had a falling out with Bell Media after Bell rightfully prevented the new owner from cutting down trees located on Bell’s property.  The blog states the new owner demanded Bell to pay $1,000 a month to use the access road, in addition to $34,000 in back pay going back to when the new owner first purchased the property.  Faguy agrees with Bell that this demand was a “ridiculous sum and offered to pay $5,000 a year, with no back pay.”  The owner refused Bell’s act of good faith.  \r\n\r\nBell Media also has a tenant (Spectrum Communications) on the tower who pays $14,000 annually until the lease expires in August 2015.  Faguy maintains that this lease payment is not enough to justify the $91,000 a year cost to run the tower and its transmitters. \r\n\r\nBell experienced even further frustration with the transmitter when the power went out at the tower causing CKCO-TV-2 to go off air.  Faguy states, “Bell discovered a serious fault in the electrical system which required a series of repairs, but again the owner of the road denied access.” There was one other way to access the tower through a tiny strip of land connecting Bell’s land to the road.  This tiny strip of land could only be travelled via snowshoe.  \r\n \r\nThe blog further goes on to say that Bell has decided to “give up on the 230-metre-high-tower and hand back the license for CKCO-TV-2.”  Faguy reports there are no plans to move the transmitter since the station received very little response about the CKCO-TV-2 being off air.

It operated in Canada for only a period of two years and shut down in April 2015 after it filed for bankruptcy earlier that year. So what really lead to this company going broke?**\r\n\r\n #### High Expectations\r\nCanadian consumers had high expectations from Target. The company’s Canadian expansion was unsuccessful as it could not live up to these high expectations. Customers were left disappointed as the stores had higher product prices and lower product selection than Target stores in the U.S. Trade analysts believed that Target was being too aggressive in building its Canadian operations and termed it as a ‘case study in what retailers should not do when they enter a new market’.\r\n\r\n #### Target’s operational problems\r\nIt could be stated that operational problems were one of the main reasons for the company’s decline. This began when the company started out its journey in Canada with an overly ambitious launch schedule, a somewhat inexperienced leadership team, which was expected to deal with the biggest crisis in the company faced since its inception. In short it could be said that the giant chain was actually knocked over by basic and mundane errors it made. \r\nThe company had decided it wanted to grow as quickly as possible if it were to enter Canada, rather than pursue a slow expansion, this, as they learnt later was a huge blunder. \r\n\r\n #### The company’s measures for survival\r\nTarget did everything it could to keep the company up and running and maybe even make profit. Employees in Minneapolis were seconded to work on the Canadian launch. Target poured in resources and removed barriers that could slow the progress. However the compressed timelines negatively impacted the output. It was racing against a clock and made simple mistakes, for example building a new distribution centre could take a few years, however in Canada it planned to do it in less than two years, additionally it decided to build three. \r\n\r\n #### Technology mishaps\r\nTechnology too was one of the most important factors deciding Target’s presence in Canada. In the U.S, it used a custom made system that had been fine tuned to meet the exact needs of the company. These systems were of crucial importance to their working there. However in Canada it was tricky to use the same software as it was not set up to deal with a foreign country and would have to be customized to take into account the change in currency and even the French language. Making these changes to the customized software would take time, but the company did not have any time and hence a ready-made solution was to be implemented even if there was not suited for its exact needs and the company had no experience using it. \r\n', 0, 6, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'Canadian consumers had high expectations from Target, but it operated in Canada for only a period of two years and shut down in April 2015.

It is not easy to estimate the numbers and value of the arms the country is sending out into the world. \r\n\r\n Military grade equipment is made by big players in the Canadian market. Armored vehicles for use on battlefields, Long-range rifles and the technology behind bomb guidance systems remain a few things that Canadian companies excel at. Yet we don’t know anything about how many of these are being made and exported.  \r\n\r\n"There is really no way to get a complete picture of specifically what kinds of weapons and other equipment is being produced, and where it is potentially going and where it can end up."  Kenneth Epps, a policy adviser at Ploughshares Project, an NGO that monitors Canada''s military industry said\r\n\r\nRecently, Canadian news organizations have reported that advanced sniper rifles manufactured by a Winnipeg company, PGW Defence Technologies could have fallen into the hands of Houthi rebals in Yemen.  The Houthi rebals remain at the centre of international conflict and are fighting a war against forces backed by Saudi Arabia. \r\n\r\nPeople who closely follow the Canadian arms trade market were shocked to see the Canadian made guns being displayed proudly by Houthi rebels on posts made in social media. Many remarked that the Canadian arms trade lacked transparency which could cause human rights violations. \r\n\r\n"Of course military goods can be used to protect people, but they can also cause of a lot of damage. It is life and death. Considering the consequences, there has to be more transparency," Hilary Homes of Amnesty International Canada said.\r\n\r\nCanadian companies also make other kinds of military grade technology including advanced sighting systems, surveillance drones, chemical agents for controlling crowds and related equipment. \r\n\r\nHowever specific data is not easily available and still remains very difficult to obtain. There are various monitoring groups apart from the government departments that collect and publish data on the arms market but each uses various definitions making comparisons and analysis very difficult.  \r\n\r\nFor example, export data could be complicated by the names of categories being fairly unclear. They could just be labeled ‘technology’ or have names such as ‘specially designed components’.\r\n\r\nSome data that is available shows that the nation had a good year in 2012 and exported more than $1 billion worth in military good and technology category.  But the data in the report did not include military arms and technology exported to the U.S. As Canada mostly produces parts and components of larger weapons and weapon systems it is tricky to know where these are actually going or where they could potentially be used. \r\n\r\nWhen an export permit is granted it is assumed that the country they export to will be where the part or defence component is used, however it could be incorporated into larger weapons made in the country where the parts were exported to and then shipped off to other countries. \r\n\r\nBut things are looking up as the liberals have committed to sign the United Nation''s Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). Canada remains the only remaining NATO-member to not have signed the agreement.

Major Banks were interested in it, the market place was changing, startup companies were being fuelled by the currency and the technology that powered it. \r\n\r\nJobs were created and investments were made. Then it all changed. The debate on the decentralized payment system grew bigger and lawmakers from across the world were drawn in. \r\n\r\nBitcoin, which has been called an innovative payment network and a new kind of money, now needs to prove it is not dead. \r\n\r\nBitcoin is basically a payment system and a digital asset.  The system is peer-to-peer which means users can transact directly without an intermediary. It is created as a reward for payment processing work in which users offer their computing power to verify and record payments into a public ledger. This activity is called mining and miners are rewarded with transaction fees and Bitcoins.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Bitcoin exchange organized a meeting in an attempt to make progress on a major issue, one that was tearing the Bitcoin community apart as it became more widely used, the underlying software’s questionable capacity to process the growing number of transactions.\r\n\r\n Whether it can deal with the huge number of transactions remains one issue, however the currency remains clouded in controversies. A lead developer quit and declared Bitcoin dead, the reason he gave was simple the Bitcoin network could run out of capacity as the volume of transactions increased. When the network runs out of capacity it would become unreliable and vulnerable to fraud.\r\n\r\nThe media attention over the issue also arose from developers who split off and coded a different version of the software thus making it very difficult for users to decide what action to take. To switch or to stay?\r\n\r\nAt the meeting organized by the Chinese Bitcoin exchange, the developers finally came to a consensus on what to do. An agreement was signed which supported doubling Bitcoin’s capacity around the end of April, and then introducing a new version of the Bitcoin that would be the standard version by July 2017. But the new version the Bitcoin core software has both fans and haters. \r\n\r\nCompanies investing in Bitcoin based projects would have to continue relying on the same original core group of developers, who prioritize freedom from censorship and decentralization over earning profits.  \r\n\r\nThe new version made by the developers who quit the original group is called Bitcoin classic. This has some supporters as well. They still urge others to switch to Bitcoin classic and feel there hasn’t been much done yet and the decisions regarding the future of the original Bitcoin are not enough.   \r\n\r\nHowever a spike in Bitcoin prices after the agreement was made suggested that investors were not worried. \r\nThe bitcoin still remains the best example for a decentralized financial system.

The company has a team of music experts to create playlists for every conceivable genre.\r\n\r\nThe strategy may seem weird to an outsider, as these days consumers are spending more times on their mobile phones and tablets rather than watching Television. But Stingray looks like it is beating the odds, the company claims it is competing with bigger and better funded competitors rather than the smaller online music companies.  \r\n\r\nStingray Digital, which specializes in digital media including interactive music broadcasting and distribution, feels that once venture funding for small players in the music industry ceases, it would be just be Google and Apple that would run the show. \r\n \r\nSwedish company Spotify could remain on the music scene, but other players could disappear, the company feels. This claim could even be substantiated, as Google acquired Songza, a streaming music service. Rdio, which declared bankruptcy, was acquired by California based Pandora. \r\n\r\nHowever the Canadian company Stingray stayed strong and healthy, its strategy proving it right, the company’s direct customers are satellite providers and cable providers. Not having to deal directly with angry music fans on the internet has proved to be lucrative for it. \r\n\r\nThe satellite and cable providers pay the company to carry its channels. The channels themselves too follow a different business model as they are not interactive. As the viewers don’t choose the songs or genre, the company spends a lot less on paying royalties to music artists than on-demand services and in the process makes the service cheaper for the providers too.  \r\n\r\nThe fact that the service is available on satellite and cable TV means that it is reaching a huge number of households. The company recently reported that 138 million households have access to its channels worldwide. This is higher than Spotify which has 20 million paying subscribers. \r\n \r\nThe comparison may not be entirely fair though, Spotify’s subscribers are paying just to use the service while Stingray’s end consumers may or may not be listening to music on the channels. \r\n\r\n Stingray could win the music battle against venture capital backed streaming service companies if it continues to use its intuitive approach and understanding of the music industry.', 0, 11, 0, 0, 1, NULL, 'Montreal based Stingray Digital is the new music industry player to look out for.

Here are some reasons why the new package could disappoint you. \r\n\r\n**No big changes**\r\n\r\nThere are no huge changes seen in the package offered in Quebec. Videotron is the main market player in Quebec and the company has offered its version of the package with additional channels at extra price for many years. So this is not a really new phenomenon here. Hence, the company does not really have to completely overhaul the way it operates. There $25 skinny basic plan is actually very similar to the old plan. There are some differences. CBC News Network is available in the package, due to an order that news networks should be available in minority language communities. However RDI is not included. In other provinces the reverse is done, while RDI is mandatory CBC News is not included in their skinny basic package. Also Stingray music channels are not included in the basic package. Another difference would be that Montreal’s basic package would not include CJOH, Granby and Sherbrooke would not be able to access Canal Savoir with just the package, and Gatineau would not have access to most Montreal stations.\r\n\r\n**You still have to pay set-top box rental, installation fees and taxes**\r\n\r\nThis would seem a no-brainer. However some people seemed to have wrongly presumed that the customers choosing skinny basic packages would not have to pay rental and the charge included taxes. Like other packages, customers of the skinny package too would have to shell out extra monthly fees for the TV receiver, or box rental and HD channels.  The CRTC has clearly mentioned that the $25 is for the programming only. A set top box could have monthly rental fees of between $5 and $10 depending on the service provider. New customers would have to pay extra installation charges. \r\n\r\n**No deals and discounts for those who choose the skinny package**\r\n\r\nCompanies are aiming to make the skinny starter package look as unattractive as possible so that customers would choose their pricier deals. There will be almost no deals offered for those choosing the basic package and you can forget all about discounts. For those who don’t choose the skinny basic package, companies could offer various attractive discounts occasionally and also include deals such as free equipment rental, new customer discounts and customer retention discounts\r\n\r\n**Popular channels could be more expensive**\r\n\r\nIf you were looking forward to buying only TSN and Sportsnet separately and take a basic package, then you are going to be disappointed.  You need to pay $50 to buy the 10 channel package which includes these if you are a Videotron customer. Shaw customers however can add them separately with the basic package for $8 each or $12 for both. The cost of add on channels are not regulated by the CRTC, which means the most popular channels could also be the most expensive channels. \r\n\r\n**Keeping your old package could actually be cheaper**\r\n\r\nIf you are someone who watches various channels and don’t like the idea of only having a few basic channels, but was planning on getting the basic package anyway and pay for extra channels separately, then it makes more sense to actually just keep our old package. Think of it like shopping in bulk at a grocery chain, the more you buy the less the unit cost. \r\n\r\n**Some channels could cease to exist**\r\n\r\nIndependent channels don’t have free advertising on CTV, Global or TVA. The channels like Vision, OUTtv and iChannel could face a threat to their existence. While the CRTC regulations do encourage providers to showcase the channels, the drop in number of subscribers to these channels could make it difficult for them to thrive in a difficult economic environment.\r\n\r\n**Some channels’ quality of content may become low** \r\n\r\nChannels may have some good shows during the prime time slot, but the rest of the day could feature reruns or less impressive content. Some channels could have only one or two good shows that you want to watch but you would have to subscribe for that particular channel anyway.\r\n\r\n**TV viewing market will change**\r\n\r\nWill the add-ons and HD channels make the TV viewing scenario different? What content are the viewers actually going to prefer paying for? Will everyone just stick to the basic package and forget all about the other channels? Are channels going to be expensive or will they be much cheaper to attract more subscribers?\r\n\r\nThe TV viewing market will change making it difficult for advertisers as well.

Here are 5 tips from [The Dragons](http://www.cbc.ca/dragonsden/blog/5-most-common-small-business-canadian-tax-mistakes) you should do to make filing taxes much easier. \r\n\r\n**Don’t combine your business and personal accounts**\r\n\r\nSmall business owners could sometimes use their personal funds to invest in their company’s growth. While it may seem like the best way to fund your business when you start it, both the company’s and your personal finances could suffer, \r\n\r\nSeparate your company’s bank accounts from your own, making sure you already know and are regularly keeping track of what transactions are taking place in both these accounts. This way when tax season is around you will find it much easier. \r\n\r\nExtend this principle into your credit cards as well. You will find it much easier to keep track of monthly statements once you have already separated your personal and businesses’ expenses. \r\n\r\n**Make sure you save all paperwork and receipts**\r\n\r\nThe urge to throw away a receipt is real, but don’t give in, keep all receipts however small. \r\nMake sure you store all your paperwork and receipts in labeled files or folders so that you will find it easy to sort out at the end of the financial year. \r\n\r\n**Seek advice from experts**\r\n \r\nYou are not a tax expert, so seek out advice from one. Don’t hesitate to spend money on an accountant, or you could lose money in the long run. Keep track of deductions you are entitled to and keep a separate folder for monitoring those. \r\n\r\n**Double check everything**\r\n \r\nMake sure you double check every number on the tax filing, check for spellings of words, and signatures. The most common errors found include incorrect social insurance numbers and wrong postal codes. If you have made an error you can amend your tax return later, but save the hassle and make sure it is error free in the first place. Make sure you have not overlooked anything. Asking another person to check everything before you file it is also a good way to check for errors you may have overlooked. \r\n\r\n**Use accounting software and professional ways to deal with accounting tasks**\r\n \r\nUsing a spreadsheet to keep track of financials could seem like an easy task when you first start up. As you make more transactions per day you will realize that it is not as efficient as you thought. Using accounting software could solve this problem and you could make the whole process much more efficient. The professional accounting software keeps tracks of all necessary information, and identifies trends in sales apart from giving you a quick overview when you need it.', 0, 10, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'Canadian small businesses are probably already feeling the tax deadline pressure.

', 'Crowdfunding is the process of raising money to fund what is typically a project or business venture through many donors using an online platform, such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo and Crowdfunder. \r\n\r\nMany startups and new entrepreneurs turn to crowd funding to bring their ideas to life. However, there are some mistakes they make. Creating a prototype of a product could actually be easier than mass producing it to start earning money from it.  While there are many projects which have been successfully funded, there are some which face delays and are even called off due to the operational difficulties after getting investment. \r\n\r\nMeeting the financial crowd funding goal is not enough to start up a business successfully. The life of a startup could actually depend on various other factors that impact the final outcome of the product. \r\n \r\nFor example, Wales based Torquing Group raised around $4 million last year on Kickstarter for its Zano drone, but it eventually shut down after a few months as manufacturing the drone wasn’t feasible and backers were left with nothing. Another example, but on a lower scale of losses, was the Toronto based Undone Labs’ Cobra Wallet, which managed to raise $69,000 in 2012 before it too met a similar end. \r\n\r\nNo business or startup wants to be in such a situation, as it tarnishes the product and also causes losses to backers who can be ruthless and unforgiving. It also results in a harder crowdfunding environment as potential backers become more skeptical of projects. \r\n\r\nAccording to experts, the only way to deal with the issue at hand is to have management expertise before organizing the crowdfunding campaign. Using manufacturing and supply-chain management systems experts could make it a better transition. \r\n\r\nEntrepreneurs are not really equipped to deal with the various challenges the company would have to face after the crowdfunding phase is over, they sometimes chalk out plans for offshore manufacturing that could not go as they had expected. \r\n\r\nWith the advent of 3D printers, making a prototype has gotten easier than ever, starting a crowdfunding campaign too has become easier, there are many potential backers out in the market as well. But the supply-chain expertise after the funding has arrived is not easy to find, and that part of the process comes with many un-anticipated issues. \r\n\r\nThe focus of many crowdfunded companies is often to build the product, however in the process they forget that this is a new company and building the company and its brand is just as important. \r\n\r\nMost of the crowdfunded companies have great ideas and a really great prototype leading to getting all the funding they require but many crowdfunding backers fail to realize that they are putting their dollars into the idea and not the actual product.', 0, 10, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'While there are many projects which have been successfully funded, there are some which face delays and are even called off due to the operational difficulties after getting investment.', 'Staff', '', '2016-03-27 20:23:00', '2016-03-27 20:36:21'),

New entrants to the fashion world usually work crazy hours for very little recognition and remuneration. But there is another reason the designers of Canada are not seeing success internationally. \r\n\r\nDesigners, who are usually very creative minded people, are not experts in the business side of their profession. They work hard and are very talented but could lack an entrepreneurial mind which is very important in running a fashion company, industry experts feel. \r\n\r\nThere are many global opportunities, which our domestic designers could be missing out on. Canada, which exports about $1 billion in textiles a year, should certainly be doing better in the international fashion scenario than it is now. Most of Canada’s fashion exports are to the U.S\r\n\r\nThe brands also face issues with infrastructure in various markets as different products have specific customs and import rules which can be complicated. \r\n\r\nAnother reason could be the speed the business requires. The fashion industry operates on the basis of speed, seasons change, fashions change. Producing a collection and then having it stopped somewhere for noncompliance of export or customs regulations is one of the worst things to happen to a designer. \r\n\r\nDesigners don’t have access to easy funding either, they have to face various hurdles and borrow from lenders to start up their business.

The actual amount depends on how much you can afford to save, increase it after a year.

Treat your emergency fund like a bill you must pay every month. \r\n\r\n**What is an emergency?**\r\n\r\nDecide what you will consider an emergency, an unexpected health scare or home repair that cannot be put off can be a real emergency.

Vidyard’s CEO Michael Litt recently said his company has benefited hugely from its association with Salesforce, from the knowledge of its executives to the lessons that can be gleaned from its “vast” portfolio of other investment companies.\r\n\r\nVidyard’s customer base and associated revenue rose 380 percent in the past year and the company apart from expanding its offices recently made its first acquisition. \r\n\r\n “It’s been a significant growth year for us,” Litt said, crediting Salesforce Ventures with providing many of the contacts and customer references needed to make it happen. “It’s been very rewarding to work with them and see our business grow together.”\r\n\r\nCanada remains one of the most important markets for Salesforce and there could be more Canadian companies like Vidyard.', 0, 18, 10, 0, 1, NULL, 'Experts feel that Canadian startups remain underfunded when compared with their U.S counterparts.

', '', 'Here Are 5 Apps That Are Designed to Help You Manage Your Money Better. ', 'Do you write down all your expenses? Do you wonder at the end of the month where all your money went? Do you want to keep a tab on your budget? \r\nIt is time to make use of technology to keep an eye on your financial transactions. \r\nHere are 5 apps that are designed to help you manage your money better. \r\n\r\n**Mint**\r\n\r\nPlatforms: iOS, Android, Web\r\nCost: Free\r\nDeveloper: Intuit\r\nSynopsis: Mint is the app to download if you are looking for the most popular option. It has been a favorite with consumers since it was introduced due to the overwhelming amount of options it has. \r\n\r\nWhat to expect: This app will slot all your purchases into different spending categories and make it easier for you see where your money is going to and coming from. There are various charts that can be automatically pulled from the financial data you have stored. \r\n\r\nPros: Mint has notifications for various transactions that you can customize. For example you can have email alerts for when a bill is due or when there is unusual spending in one category. The app also helps you create personalized budgets to keep track of all transactions. Mint also has a smart watch companion app. \r\n\r\nCons: This could be a con for most financial planning apps. You should be comfortable with providing your personal information including bank account and credit card numbers. While the company claims the data is secure and encrypted a normal user could be put off by this. However, the app does require a password each time it is accessed giving it an additional layer of security. \r\n\r\n**Wally**\r\n\r\nPlatforms: iOS, Android\r\nCost: Free\r\nDeveloper: Napkin SAL\r\nSynopsis: Simple and easy to use. The app has won over many users and tech critics for its visually pleasing and easy to use interface. \r\n\r\nWhat to expect: Wally’s colorful text and charts make it easy to use. The layout is easy to navigate and you can set up alerts and reminders as well. All information has to be entered by you, so it is a great way to avoid providing your bank and credit card information. You have to remember to pull out the app each time you make a purchase or receive a deposit. \r\n\r\nPros: Safety seems to be the major factor enticing users to Wally. The developers say no data is stored on remote servers and instead stays on your mobile device. You can even backup your data. \r\n\r\nCons: While some people would be enticed by the safety that Wally offers, others could be put off by the fact that transactions need to be fed into the app manually. There is another option too; a photo of the receipt will ensure the app pulls out financial data from it for easy use. However the main con that users have noted is that the app while being suited for individual use is tricky for families to use on multiple devices.\r\nChronicle\r\nPlatforms: iOS, Mac\r\nCost: $5.79 for iOS or $16.99 for Mac desktop\r\nDeveloper: LittleFin LLC\r\nSynopsis: Chronicle focuses on managing bills, there is a section in the interface that also helps track expenses and planning but the primary purpose of this app seems to be to keep bills in check. \r\n\r\nWhat to expect: The interface is clean and well designed making it easy for users to view pending bills, there is also a calendar view to make paying bills easier. An internal browser also pops up to make payments without leaving the app. Chronicle also has an Apple Watch component. \r\n\r\nPros: The app’s archive is easy to use and makes it simple to find your bills at a later date. Receipts can also be saved to be used in the future. The Chronicle also has the option to sync data between the iOS and Mac with iCloud making it easy to access information from various devices. \r\n\r\nCons: There are two major cons, the first is the $5.79 price which is steep compared to the free apps on offer, the app gets even pricier if you add in the Mac software. Another important con is that this app is only available on Apple operating systems making it totally out of reach for Android users. \r\n\r\n**Good Budget**\r\n\r\nPlatforms: iOS, Android, Web\r\nCost: Free, or $16.99 for three months of Plus Plan\r\nDeveloper: Dayspring Technologies\r\nSynopsis: Good Budget uses the envelope budgeting method. This is specifically useful for those who have been following a cash envelope system. One envelope of cash is designated for each category that goes empty when you spend it. This app makes you decide in advance about the amount you are looking to spend for each category and encourages you to stick to it as your envelope will turn empty if you don’t.  \r\n\r\nWhat to expect: The app has a simple interface with a status bar for each envelope, as you enter your expenses into the app, it will tell you the amount that remains in each envelope. Good Budget also has the planning tools and basic charts that most other financial planning apps do. This app is a good way to stay on budget as the decline in funds in each envelope makes you realize how much you are spending and that your envelope could soon be empty. \r\n\r\nPros: Good Budget has various reports for users to download. The app can also suggest a blackout period if you are spending more than the budgeted amount for a specific category.  \r\n\r\nCons: The basic app is free, but it only offers 10 monthly envelopes and 10 annual envelopes. While the number of envelopes needed depends on the actual planner, there is also a paid plan that offers unlimited envelopes for better planning. This app is also good for families as it can be synced with 5 devices.  The premium paid app is expensive at $16.99 for 3 months. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Your bank**\r\n\r\nPlatforms: Varies	\r\nCost: Free\r\nDeveloper: Varies\r\nAt a glance: Your banking provider most probably has apps that you can use. Though they may not be similar or comparable to the others we have listed above, they could be useful when used with other apps or a notebook. \r\n\r\nWhat to expect: Don’t expect a life changing app and you will be happy. These apps are great for simple uses such as keep track of your account balance, transferring money, paying bills etc. Some even offer smart watch functionality. \r\n\r\nPros:  There are specific apps suited for various uses. For example mortgage payments and portfolio management. \r\n\r\nCons: there aren’t a lot of cons, but interface and functionality of the apps may not be great. Getting to know what apps your bank offers could offer you a head start and you could be surprised by their functions.', 0, 10, 21, 0, 1, NULL, 'Do you write down all your expenses?

Bank of Montreal opted to build the product in house rather than partner with a financial technology firm. \r\n\r\nOther large Canadian banks too have hinted that they would enter the online investment advice business. \r\n\r\nThis launch is in the wake of concerns that banks could lose market share if young customers ditch traditional banking services for finance startups that offer low cost online investment management. \r\n\r\nBank of Montreal’s brand gives it an advantage over startups providing similar services, Joanna Rotenberg, head of personal wealth management said. \r\n\r\n “We’ve got the reliability associated with a 200-year-old banking institution, and at the same time we’ve got a lot of the things that some other players in the market are offering, which is simple and digital tools, So we’re really bringing together the best of both worlds” Rotenberg added.\r\n\r\nClients who don’t have enough assets to warrant hiring an investment advisor have only few options beside mutual funds. Robo-advisers aim to fill that gap in the marketplace by providing a cost effective investment option for such clients.\r\n\r\nWhile the new service can be used by anyone, it was created for millennials as they prefer online transactions and may have only limited investment knowledge. \r\n\r\nBank of Montreal said it used clear, jargon free language and a simple responsive website design which would provide users the same experience regardless of whether it was accessed through a Smartphone, Tablet or a Computer \r\n\r\nSigning up for the services is easy. Clients first fill up an online questionnaire that includes information about investment goals, time horizon and their tolerance for risk.\r\n\r\nOther questions include annual income, net worth and how much loss they can bear. The client is then enrolled in one of the five model portfolios made up of Bank of Montreal’s own exchange-traded funds.\r\n\r\nThe minimum account size for SmartFolio is $5,000 and fees are charged as a percentage of assets under management, starting at 0.7 per cent for the first $100,000 and gradually moving lower.For a $5,000 account, the annual fee comes out to $60, according to an online calculator featured on the SmartFolio site.\r\n\r\nHowever, the services charges appear higher than some of the startups in the business such as WealthSimple and WealthBar.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of Montreal also added that though named ‘robo-adviser”, Clients may be able to access the service without a face-to-face meeting with another human being, but the portfolios are still managed by professional money managers.', 0, 10, NULL, 0, 1, 54, 'A robo-advisor is an online wealth management service that provides automated, algorithm-based portfolio management advice without the use of human financial planners.', 'Staff', '', '2016-04-12 04:20:13', '2016-04-12 04:26:23'),

The city, which is desperate for affordable housing, is said to have around 10,800 empty homes. \r\n\r\nThis has led to City councillors calling on the provincial government to take steps to help ensure vacant units are filled. These measures could include punitive tax against owners of vacant properties.\r\n\r\nThe number of vacant homes in Vancouver is not completely out of line with the rest of Metro Vancouver.\r\n\r\nFor single-family homes, duplexes and row houses the vacancy rate in Vancouver is only about one per cent, and that rate has been static since 2002, according to the report. However for vacancy rate for condominiums and purpose built rental apartments is 7.2 per cent.\r\n	\r\nThe average of vacant apartments across Canada for census metropolitan areas over 200,000 people was 7 per cent, according to the study. Windsor had the highest vacancy rate at 16.5 percent, and London came in close with a 13.5 percent vacancy rate. Quebec had the lowest rate, at 5 percent, followed by Toronto at 5.4 percent.\r\n\r\nThe method used to identify non-occupied houses is to check the electricity used. The house was deemed empty for the given year if the electricity showed little variability for more than 25 days a month and the house was not occupied for each of four “non-heating” months, August, September and the following June and July. \r\n\r\nWhile this method was good to review houses purchased for investment purposes and left empty, it would miss out houses used by owners only during the summer and left empty the rest of the year. Some houses which are occasionally rented out on Airbnb would also not be targeted. \r\n\r\nHouse owners and renters have felt for years that investors buying homes and keeping them empty has cut down supply thus driving up prices. \r\n\r\nIn a letter to Premier Christy Clark, Mayor Gregor Robertson had suggested a series of measures, including amendments to the Vancouver Charter and the Community Charter, to strengthen the ability of municipalities to ensure vacant units are filled.  \r\n\r\nSome experts believe Vancouver cannot reduce the number of empty homes without help from the province because the Vancouver Charter does not allow council to mandate occupancy.\r\n\r\n “If council did want to take action on this issue, it would absolutely require that we work with senior government,” Matthew Bourke, the lead on the empty homes report said. \r\n\r\nWhile we await further action on this, it remains to be seen whether taxing empty homes will solve Vancouver’s affordable housing issues.', 0, 16, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'This has led to City councillors calling on the provincial government to take steps to help ensure vacant units are filled.

Rising costs have put Vancouver’s growth at risk as tech employees and other millennials are heading out to affordable locations including Victoria and Kelowna. \r\n\r\nOther big cities with increasing housing prices too have seen younger people moving out as they decide their increasing expenses are too much to bear. \r\n\r\nConsulting firm Demographia ranked Vancouver as the third least affordable housing market behind Sydney and Hong Kong.

Home -- You must create an environment where people feel safe enough to grow and change.\r\n2. Edge -- Each person in your organization needs to identify what, exactly, their growing edge actually is (everyone, no exceptions).\r\n3. Groove -- You must embed practices in "way we do things around here" that actively support and challenge people to grow--on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in organizational change and have been around the block once or twice, you may have found yourself a bit disenfranchised or frustrated by how most leadership development doesn''t seem to stick, this book might be for you. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## [Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business](http://myBook.to/smarterfasterbetter)\r\nby Charles Duhigg \r\n\r\nPulitzer Prize winning author of [The Power of Habit](http://myBook.to/powerofhabit), Duhigg details how people have the ability to make any job or idea more efficient and creative. Through storytelling, anecdotal examples and research he describes how people get caught in tunnel vision, bogged in negative corporate culture and stuck in projects. For example, one of the interesting findings comes from university researchers who discover that everyday people have an uncanny ability to forecast events when they are versed in probabilistic thinking which is the use of probabilities.\r\n\r\nAlmost in the same vein of the popular Freakonomics, Smarter Faster Better shows how two seemingly different teams, Google and Saturday Night Live, use similar team building plans to create a successful workplace. There are good examples of what these successful entities do and also examples of how others fail. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## [#AskGaryVee: One Entrepreneur''s Take on Leadership, Social Media, and Self-Awareness](http://myBook.to/askgaryvee2)\r\nby Gary Vaynerchuk\r\n\r\nThe New York Times bestselling author draws from his popular show #AskGaryVee to offer surprising, often outrageous, and imminently useful and honest answers to everything you’ve ever wanted to know—and more—about navigating the new world.\r\n\r\n#AskGaryVee reads like transcripts from the show, and that’s OK when the information being dispensed is this persuasive and accessible. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## [How to Have a Good Day: Harness the Power of Behavioral Science to Transform Your Working Life](http://myBook.to/haveagoodday)\r\nby Caroline Webb\r\n\r\n“Webb has given us a great gift: she has synthesized all the advice coming out of labs around the world, filtered it for quality, and illustrated it with well-chosen examples.” —Jonathan Haidt, NYU-Stern School of Business\r\n\r\nThe 21 chapters break down the stages of having a good day into seven parts: priorities, productivity, relationships, influence, relationships, and resilience.

Here are 5 things you must know. \r\n\r\n## Learn the basics; don’t leave everything to your accountant \r\nIt is important to know the basics of your finances, your accountant can only help with the information you provide them. Keeping an eye on your finances throughout the year is the key to being in control during the tax season. For example, penalties for not disclosing foreign assets worth more than $100,000 could be steep, and having a U.S. bank account could fall into that category. \r\nTax preparers could miss out something like that if you don’t bring it up. \r\n\r\n## Stick to the deadline \r\nYou may feel you aren’t ready to file on the required date since you know you owe an amount which you may not have, but it is much better to file right away than have to deal with the penalties later.  \r\nApart from the penalties being high, filing on time also makes it easier as the Revenue Agency can work out a payment plan with you. \r\n\r\n## Report other incomes \r\nMany tax filers remain scared about reporting their additional income, don’t be. If you have earned some income running a small side business or doing some freelance work disclosing it to the authorities will make life much easier for you. \r\nNot only is it legally necessary to report that income, the tax bill doesn’t have to be large if you are reporting the expenses on the job as well. \r\nIf your side business is not doing particularly, you can actually save tax, as the loss can be applied to reduce your other income. \r\n\r\n## Save the receipts \r\nThis one should be a no-brainer, unfortunately it isn’t. People tend to forget that medical expenses can give them tax credit. Prescription medication and health insurance deductions can count towards medical expenses, if these expenses are higher than 3 percent of your annual income then you can save on tax.

Communication is one of the most important skills of a good entrepreneur, knowing how and when to communicate and when to not communicate is an essential skill in the world of business. \r\n\r\nCommunication skills are not just important while building your business but will remain necessary throughout its lifespan. First you will have to bring your vision to life, then use your communication skills to inspire your co workers, build investor confidence and gain good publicity. \r\n\r\nAnother point to note is that communication is not a one-way street, speaking to others is just half of it, listening and making sure others feel heard is the other half of communication. \r\n\r\nEven the best entrepreneurs are constantly seeking to improve their verbal and non verbal communication.  \r\n\r\n## Multitasking \r\nWe live in the age of multitasking. To be successful entrepreneur you would have to perform multiple tasks at the same time, while making sure each of these are doing efficiently. As your business grows, you will employ more people, expect your tasks to change but anticipate that you will still be working as hard. The bigger your business gets the more you will have to manage. \r\n\r\nAs you will have to be involved in many things at the same time, time management is very important. A successful person is one who can manage his time efficiently and use it to its maximum potential. Remember that while you own the business you should not let your business own you, give importance to your own health and family too. \r\n\r\n## The small things are really the big things \r\nPaying attention to details is a very important part of being successful. Nothing is small enough to be categorized as too small. The little things are often what make a difference. You need to figure out how to deal with the details, for example managing your email well and other tasks such as sending people thank you notes could go a long way in establishing contacts and keeping your life stress free.  Be ready to take constructive criticism and work on it to make your business better.', 0, 19, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'While the question of whether formal education is important for an entrepreneur can elicit many replies depending on whom you are asking, here are 3 things that are essential to a business that has to be learnt by an entrepreneur and not necessarily at school.', 'Staff', '', '2016-04-21 03:03:22', '2016-04-21 03:12:53'),

[Netflix started carrying out their threat](https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/evolving-proxy-detection-as-a-global-service) to start cutting off users who were using VPN or proxy services to access, primarily, the U.S. version of Netflix with it''s larger share of programming. As of this week, the threat of losing access to U.S. Netflix became much more real as subscribers using VPN (Virtual Private Networks) services saw an unwelcome message: "Whoops something went wrong...you seem to be using an un-blocker or proxy. Please turn of any of these services and try again" with a link to how to disable proxies. This had been known since January, but it was not expected to be be as successful as it seems to have been.\r\n\r\nThe [reaction was swift online, with Twitter filled with threats to return to BitTorrent](http://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/netflix-officially-kills-vpn-access-canadians-very-mad-1.3543299), a file transfer technology invented in 2001 that was widely known among students due to its ability to transfer large files efficiently over slower broadband networks. Originally designed for distributing large free operating systems like Linux, BitTorrent enjoyed massive success over the next few years as people used it to download movies, even if it required some technical know-how to find movies and wade though the bad copies. Companies like Netflix, like iTunes before it, provided a simple, legal and affordable way for people to get access to content.\r\n\r\nBut the technical attack on proxies was only part of the story. The other part was financial: companies providing the VPN services depend on subscribers paying for that service so they can keep the lights on. Much like when credit card companies can choose to cut service for businesses they don''t approve of, VPN companies that advertised their services for getting around country restrictions where finding that they could no longer accept payments from their customers. PayPal also cut of support, essentially forcing them to change their business model or go out of business.\r\n\r\nTo add insult to injury, Netflix also raised their base prices this year by about $2 (US), including for customers who had been grandfathered in and spared last year''s raise. \r\n\r\nOf course, in Canada, Bell and Rogers, owners of similar streaming services CraveTV and Shomi, might pick up some subscribers who make good on their threat to cancel their Netflix accounts.\r\n\r\nThis isn''t the end of the story by any stretch. The VPN companies are probably working on ways, both technical and legally to work around this issue. Payments could be made by a currency like BitCoin (but dispite the attention it''s got in recent years, it''s still technically daunting compared to the ease of PayPal).

Sure, you split the rent, share the groceries and take turns doing the chores, but when it is tax season you should step it up a notch. \r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is that even if you do file tax returns together, you can still file your own individual return. The Canadian law has separate definitions of the term ‘marital status’ that could help you decided whether to go the joint tax filing way or not.\r\n\r\nA spouse is defined as “someone you are legally married to.”  While a Common-law partner is someone you are living in a conjugal relationship with.\r\n\r\nThe latter is defined as “You have a common-law partner if you are living in a conjugal relationship with someone who is not your spouse and at least one of the following applies - you have been living together for at least 12 continuous months (this could include any period you were separated for less than 90 days because of a breakdown in the relationship) - he or she is the parent of your child by birth or adoption - he or she has custody and control of your child (or had custody and control right before the child turned 19) and your child is completely dependent on that person for support).\r\n\r\nA separation is considered one only after a period of 90 days.

They include \r\n\r\n## Charitable Donations\r\nDonations you make can be qualified for a tax credit. The first $200 of charitable donations qualifies for a 15 percent tax credit and every dollar above $200 gets a 29 percent credit. These donations are good to be filed jointly as the total amount will increase and thus raise the total credit that can be claimed.  \r\n\r\n## Transit passes\r\nTransit expense is applicable if both you and your partner take public transit and have monthly passes, you can get a bigger return when you pool them as household expenses. \r\n\r\n## Medical Expenses\r\nMedical expenses have to add up to more than 3 percent of your net income, pooling is very helpful here as the partner with lower income can claim the total household medical expenses and thus become more likely to qualify to claim the expenses. \r\n\r\n## School	\r\nIf your partner is still in school you can use that to lower the household tax burden as the student can transfer unused tuition credits worth $5000 to the higher earning partner. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhile all of these are pros to benefit from filing taxes jointly, you should note that there are some cons too. \r\n\r\nThe three main cons are that you may not qualify for the GST/HST rebate anymore, your student loans repayments could increase and if you unfortunately end up breaking up with your partner then you will now have to deal with the paperwork apart from a broken heart. \r\n\r\nRemember that in Canada returns are coupled together during preparation and filing, your partner’s name, social insurance number and net income should be on your personal tax return.

The best solution would be to increase competition in the high speed internet access market and thus ultimately bring down the prices, they feel. \r\n\r\nSome internet providers have already started rolling out new cheaper plans, Rogers said it offers services for as low as $25 per month and advertises the deal as suitable for one person for basic internet service and charges an extra $8 modem rental fee. \r\n\r\nRogers also has a subsidized internet access plan for $9.99 a month which is available in some areas where community housing residents live.The telecom provider said the subsidized project can reach up to 150,000 residents.', 0, 13, 0, 0, 1, NULL, 'National anti-poverty group ACORN recently said internet was not a luxury anymore and was a “Human right”.

', '', 'While Sometimes Thought of as Just a Way to Make Your Car a Bit Flashier, an Automotive Tint Has Several Practical Benefits. ', 'An [Automotive Tint](http://www.mrtint.ca/) has several practical benefits to protecting your vehicle from damage to break-ins. \r\n\r\n## Reduce Sun Exposure\r\nIf you spend several hours a day inside an automobile, you could become overexposed to dangerous UV rays without even realizing it. It doesn’t matter what type of weather you are driving in, because as long as you are operating during daylight hours, you are being exposed to sunlight. You may not think about it, but you could actually be just as exposed to UV rays as someone who works outdoors all day. Over time, this can lead to skin discoloration, moles, freckles, or even skin cancer. The best way to protect yourself is by having automotive tint installed to reduce the number of rays that are entering your vehicle.\r\n\r\n## Protects your Interior\r\nAnyone who drives for long periods must also deal with the high cost of maintenance, repairs, gasoline, and insurance. If you’re already spending a lot of money on these things, the last thing you want to do is replace your seats or carpeting because they have become faded. However, you could wind up doing just that unless you take measures to protect these things. After installing window tint, your vehicle’s interior will have fewer rays beating down on it, and will therefore retain a like-new appearance much longer.\r\n\r\n## Makes Driving Easier\r\nDriving during certain times of the day can be excruciating due to sunlight beating down on your windshield. Adjusting your visor doesn’t always help, so you may wind up squinting or looking through your windshield at a different angle. Driving in this manner is dangerous, and increases the risk of an accident. If you regularly find yourself struggling with sunlight in your face, you’ll likely notice a great deal of relief once you have automotive window tint installed.\r\n\r\n## Reduces Break-Ins\r\nVehicle break-ins are on the rise, and are largely a crime of opportunity. If you must carry valuable items with you, you run the risk of having them stolen each time you stop somewhere. This is less likely to happen if you have window film installed, because anyone who is casing out vehicles will not be able to see inside yours. Since thieves are unable to determine if valuables are inside, they will likely move on to another vehicle where desirable items are prominently displayed. Few people will go ahead and break in on the off-chance there is something worth stealing inside.\r\n\r\nIf you drive for a living, window tint on your commercial vehicle is something you should seriously consider. Likewise, anyone with a long daily commute or people who travel a great deal could also benefit. Automotive window film is inexpensive and easy to install, yet will provide you with all these benefits and more.\r\n\r\n\r\nSponsored By:<br>\r\n[Mr. Tint](http://www.mrtint.ca/)<br>\r\n2370 Midland Ave. A22<br>\r\nToronto, ON <br>\r\nM1S 5C6<br>\r\n\r\n647-786-1365', 0, 20, 6, 0, 1, NULL, 'While Sometimes Thought of as Just a Way to Make Your Car a Bit Flashier, an Automotive Tint Has Several Practical Benefits.', 'Mr. Tint', 'http://www.mrtint.ca', '2016-05-03 04:18:24', '2016-05-03 04:20:29'),

Since the method of calculating days-stayed is not just the days in the current year it would be best to limit your stay to 120 days annually. \r\n\r\n## Close connection exception \r\nYou would need to file a close connection exception statement for Aliens, also known as a snowbird filing. This is an IRS 8840 form and shows the U.S. internal revenue service that despite your lengthy stay in the U.S. you do have a close connection to your homeland and should be exempt from American taxes. This filing takes into account your permanent home, personal belongings, family, social, political, cultural and religious affiliations. Your driving license and place you vote at is also considered. \r\n\r\n## Property taxes 	\r\nIf you plan to either rent out or sell your U.S. property you will be required to file a U.S. tax return. U.S. rental income has to be included in both your U.S. and Canadian tax returns. If you sell your property in the U.S. you will be subject to tax withholdings of 10 to 15 percent of the proceeds. \r\n\r\n## Documentation \r\nKeeping you documentation with you is essential and it is important that you should be able to prove your Canadian citizenship. Apart from your passport and a copy of your Canadian tax returns it is also essential to have with you other proof of citizenship such as utilities bill, mortgage agreements etc. Your travel itinerary and return tickets too should be available on hand if applicable. \r\n\r\n## Consequences back home 	\r\nHealth care is one of the major consequences of staying away for a long duration; remember that if you lose your residency status you also lose access to your provincial health care. Another consequence of losing your residency is that the CRA will make you pay taxes on capital gains as it will deem you to have sold off all your assets. If you own property in Florida or other U.S. states, upon death there is a federal and sometimes even a state inheritance tax which has no capital gains exemption. Another important fact to remember is that if you stay in the U.S. for 6 consecutive months without a visa, you could be barred from re-entry for 3 to 10 years.', 0, 16, 10, 0, 1, NULL, 'Flying out to warmer locales is a simple and comfortable decision that many Canadians take during the cold winter months.

This number is twice the land used for ginseng cultivation in 2001.

The priest, who was aware of the value of the root, informed the traders who were interested to export it to Asia. However, back then the trade did not stay strong as overharvesting and failure to dry the ginseng roots properly meant the product was lower quality than Chinese ginseng. \r\n\r\nGinseng was later cultivated in smaller quantities by the late 1800s as farmers in Ontario were more interested in another crop at the time- Tobbaco.

Have you wondered if you can really afford that new car, or if the mortgage on your new house is a little higher than you can comfortably pay?', 'Money is a delicate matter, no one wants to talk about it openly, yet many people lose their sleep over financial worries.  One key advice from financial planners is to always have a contingency plan in hand. Another is to prepare for the worst by giving yourself as much flexibility as you can. \r\n\r\nThere are many reasons when your finances, which you thought were in order, could completely surprise you. Divorce, Disability, Unemployment or an Illness in the family can all cost huge amounts of money and make your carefully made financial plan go haywire. \r\n\r\nWhat a person chooses to do in a difficult situation ultimately depends on the person’s financial ability and thought process at that particular time. However, in this article we provide you ways to deal with 5 difficult situations you may have to deal with in life. \r\n\r\n## Divorce\r\nAll marriages start out happily, no one anticipates a divorce in the early days. But along the road, things can go wrong. Being faced with the prospect of a looming divorce can make even the most financially savvy people uncertain about the future. \r\n\r\nWith children’s education to pay for, debts to settle, retirements to save for, divorce can have disastrous impacts on not just your morale but your financials too. Divorce could be a big setback in financial security as costs of living on your own are often not that lower than living with a spouse, especially if there are children involved. \r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to plan for a divorce; it is certainly not something you would want to talk about in the happy times. Couples with pre-nuptial agreements usually find it slightly easier to handle the financial aspects of the divorce. However, even with agreements in place it could remain difficult as one person could have managed the finances, while the other just relied on that person. \r\n\r\nKeeping a tab on spending habits is one of the main ways to deal with this, paying bills, buying new things, groceries, everything becomes much more expensive on a one-person income. Those who don’t adjust to the change and cut down on unnecessary spending can quickly build up debt. The future you had once envisioned now looks different but don’t give up financially. \r\n\r\n## Illness – Disability \r\nDisability can arrive unexpectedly, one minute you feel fit and fine, the next minute you have a huge hospital bill to deal with. It need not even have to be you who gets sick, a sick spouse or a child can be equally bad both morale-wise and financially. Many people do not have disability insurance and treatments and medicines can get very expensive.\r\n\r\nIf your income is hampered because of your inability to work due to the illness, you could go into further debt at a time when you are already paying through your nose for hospital bills. The main way to deal with this type of hurdle is to purchase insurance. \r\n\r\nIf you are not covered by your workplace, then you should look up a suitable plan and purchase it. The exact amount of the monthly payment would depend on your current salary, coverage you require and the duration of the insurance.  Buying disability insurance should be treated as a contingency fund item and you should remember that it will be your boat if the storm hits.   \r\n\r\nIt is easier to start a disability insurance package when you are younger, the older you get the more expensive the options become. \r\n\r\n## Illness - Mental health \r\nWhile physical disability can be very difficult, mental disability can be even more difficult to deal with. Mental illness like an addiction or depression can be very difficult to handle, it can make both your work life and family life very difficult. \r\n\r\nSevere mental illness even leads to situations where you cannot make decisions on your own. One way to deal with any future mental illness is to prepare a will. Financial decisions are not going to be easy to make when you are already under a lot of stress and dealing with your own or a loved one’s mental illness. Drafting a will to set up property and personal care can be very helping in those difficult times. \r\n\r\n## Unemployment \r\nIf you get laid off because of a bad economy or other factors that you cannot control, then you will have to deal with financial uncertainty till you can find your next source of income. In today’s uncertain economic weather, many people feel insecure about their jobs. This financial hurdle is probably easier to prepare for than the others. \r\n\r\nThere are many ways to deal with this, including starting a side-business but the most important one is to have an emergency fund that can cover your living expenses till you find your next job.  \r\n\r\nFinancial planners have often said the contingency fund should cover at least three to six months of your income. Your emergency fund should not be terribly easy to access and should be stored in a separate account and not the usual bank account you use for daily spending. \r\n\r\n## Supporting your elderly parents \r\nIn their youth, your parents spent a lot of their valuable time changing your diapers, now is the time to repay them. Supporting elderly parents could be a lot more difficult financially than you would expect. Even if they do have savings and a house which they could sell, it would still fall short to cover their expenses if they have to be moved into an old age home or a home for the elderly.  Deal with this by being prepared to use some of your own savings for your parents. Remember that you are the elders of tomorrow.', 0, 10, 21, 0, 1, NULL, 'Financial planning is one of the most difficult and yet important things to do in our daily lives.

If you decide you won’t be stressed then the battle is half won. ', 'In psychology, stress is a feeling of strain and pressure. Small amounts of stress may be desired, beneficial, and even healthy. But a lot us face more stress that is essential. \r\n\r\nThe best way to win the battle against stress is to cultivate habits that can help you reduce stress and make you deal with problems in much calmer and efficient manner. If you decide you won’t be stressed then the battle is half won. \r\n\r\nThese are not rules to follow when you are working, quite the opposite, these rules are for when you are not working. What you do with your time when you are not at work actually makes a big difference in your stress levels. \r\n\r\nIncorporate these rules into your life and feel the difference. \r\n\r\n## Rule 1 – Disconnect \r\n\r\nGadgets and technology has made it possible for you to work just about anywhere, while it is great for your business, it may not be the same for your own mental health. Take some time to disconnect. Put your phone away for at least a short duration. While staying phone-free and gadget-less for an entire weekend may not be suitable for today’s working professionals, allocate a time for you to check your emails and stick to it. Do not check your phone every 5 minutes; instead attend work related emails only during the allocated time. \r\n\r\n## Rule 2 – Chores\r\n\r\nIt is easy to get lost in the chore list. Laundry seems to multiply every minute. Don’t spend your weekend doing chores. Allocate a time schedule to doing your chores and if you are not able to finish it within the time then reallocate for another day. Don’t let chores become your weekend plan. Have a chores list and try to do as many as you can throughout the week. \r\n\r\n## Rule 3 – Work out \r\n\r\nIt is essential that you remain physically healthy to perform well mentally. Use your free time to exercise. A long walk with your partner during the summer months can be great for your body and also bonding. Find an exercise you enjoy doing, it should be something that you are passionate about, you will not just have a fitter body but a relaxed mind too. Your physical activity of choice could be anything, try different activities like swimming, running, cycling, yoga to find out which you like best. \r\n\r\n## Rule 4 – What are you passionate about? \r\n\r\nFinding a passion is a great way to inspire and motivate. Your mind will open up to new ways of thinking and soon you will forget all about stress. Your passion could be something you have always wanted to do, something you have done in the past but let go of, or something totally new that you want to learn. Singing, reading, writing, painting, the list is endless \r\n\r\n## Rule 5- Family Time \r\n\r\nSpending time with your loved ones is one of the best ways to unwind. Play with your kids at the park, or take them out for ice-cream, go out to the movies or a restaurant with your spouse, visit your parents, speak to your sister or brother over the phone. \r\n\r\n## Rule 6 – Make weekend plans \r\n\r\nSchedule some interesting activity for the weekend. Buy tickets for a new movie or a concert. Book a chefs table at the latest new restaurant, decide to go on a hike or plan a picnic with the family. Planning something you have not done before or in a long while will make you anticipate it and keep you positive throughout the week. \r\n\r\n## Rule 7 – Wake up at the same time every day\r\n\r\nSome people are early risers, they can wake up early and have a great day ahead, and others like to sleep in for a bit more. Choose a time to wake up so you can comfortably get to work and stick to that time.  When you wake up at the same time every single day your body and mind will be more alert and awake. Stick to the wake up schedule on weekends as well. Sleeping in late on weekends can make you lose a lot of time, by waking up earlier you can get your chores finished before you head out the door for the hike you planned. \r\n\r\n## Rule 8 – Contemplate life \r\n\r\nUse your weekends to look at the bigger picture, when your mind is free of the hustle of a work day you can see things much more clearly. Make your plans for the future and approach the upcoming week positively.  \r\n\r\n## Rule 9- Enjoy the weekend mornings\r\n\r\nUse the weekend mornings to pursue your passion and to exercise. By indulging in physical activity in the morning you not just feel great for the rest of the day but you feel like you have already achieved a lot and it is not even 10am. Have a healthy breakfast and use time to do things for yourself that you haven’t had time to do this week. \r\n\r\n## Rule 10- Prepare for next week\r\n\r\nIt is much easier to face anything when you have already prepared for it. Spend some time on Sunday preparing for the upcoming week. Do not over do this though. The preparation should not take up your day, only lesser than an hour. When you walk into work on Monday, you feel positive and ready to take on anything.', 0, 21, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'The best way to win the battle against stress is to cultivate habits that can help you reduce stress and make you deal with problems in much calmer and efficient manner.

', 'Cochrane, a small town with a ranching history, may not seem like a hub for technological start-ups. But a handful of companies are giving the town its new tech hub status. \r\n\r\nBuilding their business in the town of Cochrane was simply a matter of practicality for Kip Fyfe and Victoria Brilz co-founders of Dynastream Innovations Inc. Located just 35 kilometres northwest of downtown Calgary, this town had everything to offer for them. \r\n\r\nThe couple quit their jobs in Calgary and started their wearable technologies company in 1998, its offerings included heart-rate monitors, devices for runners to monitor distance etc. Their first customer was Nike. Fast forwarding to 2006, Garmin acquired Dynastream for $36-million. The company still remains in the same town. \r\n\r\nThe next business venture the couple started too was run from the same office where they first worked out of, in 2012, they started 4iiii Innovations whose products included various sport s electronics for cyclists. \r\n\r\nOther entrepreneurs too call Cochrane home, “The town has more than 20 knowledge based innovation companies,” Robert Kalinovich, economic development officer for the Town of Cochrane said. The perception about the town of Cochrane is changing, he said.\r\n\r\nThe town has many advantages for the budding entrepreneur, rent remains low, parking is available and there is the river for recreation. Out of 4iiii Innovations’ 30 employees, Mr. Fyfe estimates about one-third live in Cochrane, while the rest reside at Calgary and commute to work. \r\n\r\nAnother reason that draws entrepreneurs is the absence of a business taxes and the near absence of vehicle traffic. The town however does not have empty office spaces for new companies to move into right away, developers are being made aware of this and new buildings are likely to be developed. \r\n\r\nCochrane is surrounded by the Rocky Mountains and nestled in the Bow River Valley leading to beautiful views making it an enviable location. The outdoor activities available also make it very attractive for young entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\nWhile the geography cannot be copied, the town does many things that others can emulate. The town supports its entrepreneurs and proudly shares local stories. \r\n\r\nWhen Nathan MacLauchlan, chief technology officer at Frontier Telemetry, relocated to Cochrane from Calgary, he too was motivated by the affordable housing and nature trails. His company designs and manufactures remote camera systems that can easily integrate into Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition networks, systems for gathering and analyzing real-time data.\r\nAs the newly developed offices spaces go up in Cochrane, more entrepreneurs will come bringing their skills and help transform the place further, hopefully all the while maintaining the calm and serene nature the town is known for.', 0, 18, 0, 0, 1, NULL, 'Cochrane, a small town with a ranching history, may not seem like a hub for technological start-ups.

The best known would be Amazon, which has had an affiliate program for many years, and you''ve probably used it at least once as a customer. But have you ever been reading a review of a book or other product on a blog and clicked on a link that takes you to Amazon? In that case you''ve probably seen the affiliate system in action. If you bought the product then, part of the sale (about 4% in Amazon''s case) would go to the owner of the website you arrived from. Pretty simple, you''ve got the book you wanted, and you''ve supported the website that got you there. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, what if you had a blog and wanted to earn some extra income (or "monetize" in business-speak), you could use display ads like Google''s Adsense or Bing''s AdCentre, but people are becoming better at ignoring ads (not to mention ad blockers being built into the latest generation of Apple iPhones). Well [affiliates](https://www.friskydeals.com/frisky-deal-affiliate) are a good option because they''re not really advertisements. A visitor to your site is reading about a product you''re talking about; then you provide a link to somewhere where they can buy it. Simple. \r\n\r\n## How do you get Started?\r\n\r\nNow how do you get started? Well __Pat Flynn__, a well known internet marketer, has two simple rules:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h3>\r\n"I only recommend products as an affiliate that I’m extremely very familiar with – preferably products that I’ve used before and have helped me achieve something. If I’m not confident in the product and I don’t feel it will positively help people, I will not promote it.\r\n\r\nI never directly tell anyone to buy a product. I always recommend products based on my experience and in the context of what I’ve done or what I’m doing."\r\n\r\n<small>Pat Flynn</small>\r\n</h3>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI think that''s a pretty good strategy. Sure you could write up glorious reviews of any dodgy product, but pretty soon that''s going to hurt your credibility online. Most successful affiliate start with something they are passionate about, you''re going to have to be - the days of putting up a 1-2 page blog with some links are long gone, Google will simply ignore your page. Instead you need to be able to write regularly about a topic. Once you''ve got that, you should look into products or services you could write about, and ones out there that have some kind of an affiliate program.\r\n\r\nOnce that''s done, it''s usually just a case of signing up and the company (there are many, Amazon, Commission Junction, Frisky Deals, ShareASale just to name four) and they''ll provide a link that needs to go on your website. Most companies have content guidelines, so generally keep your sight family friendly.\r\n\r\nOne such affiliate is __Frisky Deals__, which specializes in local [deals](https://www.friskydeals.com/). They''re a bit different in that you don''t need a website, instead it''s social, you''re directing people to deals on Frisky''s website. They have deals on a range of products and services, especially local deal. This way you can tailor what you''re promoting - Pat''s first rule: on promote things you believe in! For instance, like a local dry-cleaner you go to every week, and you notice they''re running a deal though Frisky Deals? You can share a link to that deal - you''re helping support a local business and making a bit of extra money too. In this way you''re also potentially helping out Non-Profits, Local Communities, Businesses and Sports teams. All of which are always looking to get an extra source of income.\r\n\r\nBecoming an Frisky Deals affiliate is simple, simply sign up and you''re ready to go. You can invite family and friends by using Frisky Deals'' share links and you''ll earn extra money for any deal that they purchase.\r\n\r\n<iframe width="560" height="315"  style="width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OIQwXVZe4W0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit [FriskyDeals.com](https://www.friskydeals.com/)', 0, 20, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'Whatever your reason for wanting a bit more cash, affiliate marketing might be for you.', 'Friskydeals.com', 'https://www.friskydeals.com', '2016-05-29 06:11:14', '2016-06-04 22:22:31'),

The case which was a potential class-action lawsuit alleged workplace harassment and failure to provide a safe work environment.   \r\n\r\nThe rising economic pressure was attributed to the fact that 25 percent of WestJet’s flights originated at Alberta.

It makes a case that everything we know about the world is shaped by conditioning and habit. And thus, most people live their lives based on limiting rules and outdated beliefs about pretty much everything?love, work, money, parenting, sex, health, and more?which they inherit and pass on from generation to generation. But what if you could remove these outdated ideas and start anew? What would your life look like if you could forget the rules of the past, and redefine what happiness, purpose, and success mean for you?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## [TED Talks: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking](http://myBook.to/tedtalkspeaking)\r\nby Chris Anderson\r\n\r\nSince taking over TED in the early 2000s, Chris Anderson has shown how carefully crafted short talks can be the key to unlocking empathy, stirring excitement, spreading knowledge, and promoting a shared dream. Done right, a talk can electrify a room and transform an audience’s worldview. Done right, a talk is more powerful than anything in written form. This book explains how the miracle of powerful public speaking is achieved, and equips you to give it your best shot. There is no set formula; no two talks should be the same. The goal is for you to give the talk that only you can give. But don’t be intimidated. You may find it more natural than you think.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat''s six new books for this month.

', 'Crowdfunding is becoming more popular by the day. It is the practice of funding a venture by raising monitory contributions from a huge number of people and is often done online using registries.\r\n\r\nAs the Kickstarter method of pooling sources gains rapidly, there is one piece of advice that people who have dealt with crowd funding campaigns have – Hire an accountant. \r\n\r\nCrowdfunding raised US $16.2 billion globally in 2014; the number is bound to have been higher in 2015. But even with all of these monetary transactions the tax regulations on crowdfunding are not very clear. “Canadian tax law is still evolving in this area,” tax expert Allan Madan said. \r\n\r\nThe CRA evaluates crowdfunding initiatives, on a “case-by-case basis" as there are various types of crowdfunding ventures. Some could be loans, capital contributions, while others could be gifts. Some campaigns could include gifts and loans making it much more complicated to evaluate.\r\n\r\nMost crowdfunding campaigns involve raising capital from a large number of people to fund a specific business or product and offers rewards as incentives in the process. \r\n\r\n While physical products do often change hands during the crowdfunding process, with crowd funders sending rewards or early copies of the products to the investors, it cannot be seen as sales rather written off as business expenses.\r\n\r\nAnother crowdfunding model is the donation model. People seek donations for various endeavors including dealing with illness. This model is not technically sales either as it could be considered a gift. However, it is also important to note that these voluntary donations or gifts are most likely not going to give you a tax credit unless set up by a registered charity. \r\n\r\nSometimes people set up crowdfunding campaigns without a particular business project in mind but needing funds for all areas of business or a specific area that is not product related. For example recurring funding for artists can be done, but it is essential to report that as personal income and not as a donation or gift like you would for a sick child’s campaign. While the CRA does not have any clear guidelines regarding this yet, it is better to stay safe to avoid future tax discrepancies. \r\n\r\n**See also: [How to Deal With Side Incomes During Tax Season](/article/how-to-deal-with-side-incomes-during-tax-season)**\r\n\r\nThe last model of crowdfunding is not yet very popular but includes providing equity in exchange for the funds you receive. This could be a workaround to paying taxes on the contributions. \r\n\r\nCrowdfunding economics is not as easy as it looks.

Some stats demonstrate this: In 2010, Stats Canada estimated, not including the self-employed, 1.7 million Canadians worked from home, up almost 23% from the 1.4 million in 2000.\r\n\r\n## What factors are driving it?\r\nIt''s both companies and employees for different reasons. For companies the reasons are cost-savings. For employees, the work life balance is often cited as the reason for home based work with an expectation of greater facility in managing hours and demands, less commuting time and greater flexibility.\r\n\r\nAlso, [factors like housing prices can play a role](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/telecommuting-growing-as-companies-look-to-save-money-respond-to-employees-1.3596420) - with cities like Toronto and Vancouver facing sky-high real-estate costs, living in a nearby city from the company office can cost a lot less, but it''s still able to get into the office when needed; for instance telecommuting from Windsor to Toronto a growing workplace trend, even if it is a three and a half hour drive if you have to get to downtown Toronto. \r\n\r\n## Windsor-Essex Success Story\r\nIn fact, the growth of telecommuting has been for the cities too. The Windsor-Essex region is looking to promote itself as a great location for these remote office workers. The region offers the natural beauty of the region, wine country and more affordable housing: according to Canadian Real Estate Association, the year-to-date average sale price of a home in Windsor was $197,061, an increase of 5.2 per cent from 2014. In Toronto, the sale price of a home was slightly higher than $600,000. As well, as more young professionals come to the region, there''s more trendy craft breweries popping up. There''s the night market. There are a lot of great new restaurants. There''s definitely a surge of new amenities for young people that we appreciate.\r\n\r\nOther cities like Ottawa, Vancouver, Montreal and Calgary have their own satellite cities.\r\n\r\n## Is Telecommuting good for Companies?\r\nGenerally it''s another way to save money. On the other hand, managing remote employees presents challenges, and managers can feel like they don''t know what their staff is doing. Are they really working, or running errands. Typically tools can be used to track employees, but there has to be a level of trust, because if employees don''t feel trusted, this can create a negative environment. On the other hand, as one commenter said on a recent story about telecommuting, if a job can be done remotely, then it can probably also be outsourced. \r\n\r\n## Is Telecommuting good for Employees?\r\nWhile there are certainly some cost savings to having employees work out of their own homes, some research is showing there are downsides as well. \r\n\r\nFirst, not all employees are cut out for it; some just need the structure an office provides. On the other hand, there is the feeling (also common to the self-employed) of both isolation and a loss of work/life balance with people never really being "out of" the office. While this is part of a larger issue of people today virtually always being connected, working from home can aggrandize that by being at "the office" 24/7.\r\n\r\nAnother downside for employees is the sense of being cut off from the hub of social and professional activity that a workplace can provide.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some studies have shown, for employees who are adapted to it, they are more productive.

', 'Small business owners often face uncertainty when it comes to their tax strategy. What is the best way to deal with taxation such that the taxes don’t eat into your income and how should they plan their tax strategy. \r\n\r\nIf you have wondered if there was a better way to deal with your taxes then this article is just for you. Here are three ways to avoid tax, these methods are legal and the only thing you will have to spend is some time to plan. Planning is the most essential requirement to building a solid tax strategy. \r\n\r\n1. Retain money in the corporation\r\n2.  Take a corporate-owned life insurance policy.\r\n3.  Personal pension plan\r\n\r\nIncorporating a business offers benefits that help soften the tax blow; these advantages include tax deferral and income splitting. Tax deferral refers to retaining funds inside the corporation and paying tax at the personal level later while income splitting means paying dividends to family members who are in lower personal tax brackets. \r\n\r\nFinancial planners often urge clients to think twice before withdrawing funds from their incorporated companies if it means pushing up their personal income above the $220,000 mark.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have mortgage or a line of credit held at a personal level, it could carry a low rate of interest given today’s low-rate environment but it might be more beneficial to avoid accelerating the payment of debt through corporate withdrawals and instead carry the debt.\r\n\r\nThis way the funds are retained in the corporation and can be invested and withdrawn at a later date when the taxpayer is most likely in a lower tax bracket. \r\nThe main message is that if the taxpayers are earning income in their corporations that they don’t need to withdraw to live on, then it is best to retain it in the business. \r\n\r\nFinancial planners feel reinvesting the money in the business as capital or investing in a portfolio of securities inside the business is a better alternative. Another way to retain the money is in something like a corporate-owned life insurance policy.\r\n\r\nThis approach to taxation could be especially beneficial to small businesses who continue to benefit from a low tax rate in their corporations. This small business deduction is still available even after recent taxation policies.  \r\n\r\nWhile the advice to retain money in your corporation may be very sensible, you must have wondered how to bring it out once you need it.  \r\n\r\nOne way is to purchase a corporate-owned universal life-insurance policy, in this approach when the business owner dies; money is paid out through the capital dividend account which is usually tax-free to beneficiaries.  However, quick action is required to use the benefits of this approach as the new rules affecting tax free insurance beneficiaries are going to be formulated soon. If the policies are purchased this year then they will be governed by the old rules.  \r\nAnother way for taxpayers to retrieve the money they have in their corporations is to set up a personal pension plan. When contributions are made to a pension plan, they are tax deductable.  \r\n\r\nThis is a great way to plan for the future as if the business owners are taking a salary, then they are able to contribute more to a pension than an Registered Retirement Savings Plan. They also receive the benefit of tax deductions to save tax. \r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that having a comprehensive financial plan could help a lot more than any other strategy and the small business owner should be able to project what his tax bracket will be at retirement. \r\n\r\nThe financial plan should also be able to determine the dependency on corporate assets, and small business owners with surplus funds in the corporations which they intend to give to other beneficiaries like adult children should increase dividend payouts rather than make withdrawals.', 0, 10, 9, 0, 1, 57, 'Small business owners often face uncertainty when it comes to their tax strategy.

', 'In small businesses, cash flow and costs need not always be in harmony with each other, forecasting sales can be difficult and sometimes unexpected costs can make owners realise they are short on cash flow. \r\n\r\nSmall businesses especially find it difficult to deal with this situation as sometimes they are too big for the owner to borrow from friends and family, while being too small and carrying too much debt to get bank financing. \r\n\r\nThis is where the new breed of Fintech companies comes in, some of them offer invoice financing\r\nToronto-based startup FundThrough offers what is called invoice financing which means it gives companies a cash advance based on their unpaid invoices.\r\n\r\nCompanies can use these services to avoid a cash crunch when taxes are due, and helps deal with a timing issue, as the wait period for inbound cash flow is usually the main reason small businesses face these issues. \r\n\r\nFundThrough is one of a new batch of online lenders which are using invoices and other information to assess the risk of a transaction; this is a change from the credit score method. \r\n\r\nThe charges of these Fintech companies too are reasonable according to small business owners who have used them. The fee charged by FundThrough depends on whom the invoice was sent to rather than on the credit-worthiness of the borrower. The average fee is usually between 1 and 2 percent of an invoice. \r\n\r\nBanks lend to small business too, but they work on a different scope as the lending method is usually on credit cards. Credit card lenders usually charge much higher interest rates compared to Fintech companies. \r\n\r\n“Invoice financing is cheaper and faster than using a credit card,” Carolina Suarez, accounts director at Invoice Payment System Corp, a Mississauga-based company that offers invoice-based financing, said.  \r\n\r\n# Five Fintech lenders\r\n\r\n## FundThrough:\r\nThis company offers advances to small businesses backed by invoices. It charges a flat fee of 0.75 per cent to 1.25 per cent, plus a daily fee ranging from 0.025 per cent to 0.049 per cent while the invoice is outstanding. Fees are based on who pays the invoice, rather than who gets the advance. FundThrough is based in Toronto\r\n\r\n## Invoice Payment System:\r\nInvoice Payment System like its name suggests also offers invoice financing. It got its start working with the trucking industry and has expanded into other markets. It offers additional services, such as doing credit checks on the businesses its customers are invoicing, and it maintains a database of payers and how long they take to pay an invoice. It also handles collections for customers. Fees are 0.1 per cent a day, plus a flat fee of between 3 and 4 per cent. This company is based in Mississauga.\r\n\r\n## Thinking Capital: \r\nThis Company has partnered with major financial institutions, including Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Toronto-Dominion Bank. It examines how money is moving through a business to evaluate creditworthiness. Its loans and merchant advances range up to $300,000. Businesses either pay back a fixed amount or a percentage of their daily credit card sales. Its interest rates vary and can be comparable to bank loans, at the low end, or a credit card, at the high end. This company is based in Montreal.\r\n\r\n## OnDeck:  \r\nThis Company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and started operations in Canada about a year ago. It uses a proprietary algorithm to determine creditworthiness. Interest rates can vary widely; the company says they average between 0.003 per cent and 0.04 per cent a month. OnDeck is based in New York. \r\n\r\n## Borrowell:\r\nThis Company is one of the few online lenders targeting consumers and small businesses; It offers long term loans for up to five years, something its competitors do not do yet. It uses traditional credit scores and looks only at the borrower and not their business. Interest rates start at 5.6 per cent.

', 'Every athlete has faced the dilemma of buying the ever-elusive right fitting shoes. When the shoes finally fit well they are not in a colour you would have preferred, when the colour is right they are not priced well and so on. Quebec based Math Sports seems to have provided an answer to this woe. \r\nThe company sells custom made running shoes personalized to the wearer’s measurements. Math Sports measures their customer’s feet using a special scanning machine that takes precise measurements of their feet. Each shoe has custom insoles made.  \r\n\r\nThe concept of Math Shoes came to its founder Mathieu Raymond when he realised just how difficult it was to buy a pair of affordable and perfectly fitting running shoes. \r\n\r\nWhile at university Mathieu Raymond ran track and worked at a sports store, this exposure to the world of running and shoes inspired him to start a company that makes custom fit shoes. A specialist in running and jogging shoes, he noticed that most shoes rarely met all of the client’s needs. With the emphasis on comfort and physiological needs, the look of the shoes was often overlooked, much to the customer’s disappointment.\r\n\r\nIn an interview to a national media organization, Raymond said a professor challenged him to go ahead with his project. He quoted his teacher as saying - "Mathieu, you should talk about your project because there''s only a fool in a billion who is going to make a running shoe assembled in Quebec. So no one is going to steal your idea."\r\n\r\nBuyers of the custom fit shoe get to decide how big of a drop he or she wants between the heel and the toe of the shoe, how firm or soft the sole will be and how tightly the shoe fits the foot. They also get to pick the colour of the shoe, the soles and the laces. The price of these shoes is around $180. This is well within the budget of a running shoe buyer as competitors who make generic sized shoes also retail their products at similar prices. \r\n\r\nThe company’s personalized shoes are slightly cheaper in comparison at $150, the only difference between the custom-fit and the personalized versions being the custom-made insole. \r\n\r\nThe four-month old company has already produced 1,300 pairs of shoes, 500 of which were pre-orders. The components for the shoes are made overseas, but the shoes themselves are assembled in a Montreal plant.\r\n\r\nCompeting against shoe giants like Nike and Adidas is not easy for a newborn company, but Math Sports seems to be poised to face the challenge. \r\n"Our goal is to become a real shoe business that sells hundreds of thousands of running shoes per year, the final goal is to be as big, or bigger, than Nike in the USA."

They fear that if more people learn of their methods, their chances of scooping up freebies are lower. \r\n\r\nChurners can often accumulate dozens of credit cards in their process of squeezing out the rewards and bonuses that the cards offer. They stay updated on the various offers and reward that different cards offer and know where exactly to use a specific card to spend on purchases to receive the maximum reward points. \r\n29 year old Frank Leppar recently told a major media organization that he had signed up for 16 cards over the past 16 months and racked up more than 2 million reward points. He also added that getting approved wasn’t difficult. \r\n\r\nLeppar has visited Jamaica and Japan apart from 3 states in the U.S. for free using credit card reward points. He is planning a trip to Italy and either Bangkok or Singapore later this year. Churning has allowed him to book flights and hotel rooms for free. \r\n\r\nAs credit card companies get more generous with their perks, the life of a churner can be interesting but also dangerous. \r\n\r\nChurners start out simple, to receive a credit card’s sign-up bonus of 30,000 points, for example, all a churner has to do is to $1,000 on the card in three months. This is fairly simple and easy but if they apply for several similar cards at the same time then the reward points tally reaches huge figures. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is not as easy as it sounds. Only a detail oriented person can deal with multiple cards and track purchases and rewards on them, churners feel. Each card’s spending requirements have to be met, bills have to be paid, and new offers have to be tracked, apart from keeping track of the reward points on various cards.  \r\n\r\nMany churning enthusiasts say they spend at least n hour a day on their hobby and making decisions in a way that their credit rating is not a bad one. While it is possible to indulge in credit card churning without ruining your credit score, there are many people who get greedy and fall headlong into the activity and thus ruining their credit score in the process. \r\n\r\nThere are many disadvantages of credit card churning; the most common one is that your credit score will likely get a hit if you are not extremely careful. Another is that churners can end up paying a lot of annual fees, it is important to note that the more rewards a card offers, there is probably an annual fee that goes with it.\r\n\r\n It is possible to end up overspending on annual fees for some rewards that you never really wanted in the first place. Sometimes the reward points can only be used for certain things, locations, products etc which means that you will have to use what is available rather that what you would have chosen if you were paying for it with money. \r\n\r\nAs credit card churning as gotten more popular, banks and card issuers too have stepped up their game and brought in measures to curb churning. Some card issuers have implemented rules for new sign up rewards that prevents people who have already received a reward or bonus from receiving rewards again.

As a rule, try to avoid clicking on suspicious links.\r\n\r\n### 2: Stay careful when downloading anything \r\nDon’t throw caution to the wind just because you are downloading a supposedly safe application. Do a little bit of research on the application you are about to download and read all reviews on it. Stick to well known popular apps on your phone and download popular software on your computer.  \r\n\r\n### 3: Password safety\r\nIt is important not to give away your password to anyone, but this is not new, rather something that we already know. Learn other ways of password security by making sure your password is a complex one and by changing it frequently. Try to avoid using third party applications that need your passwords. \r\n\r\n### 4: Buy a good anti-virus \r\nBuy a strong anti-virus, anti-spy and anti-malware program for your computer and also make sure your mobile has the necessary security in place. Don’t hesitate to pay for a good security program and make sure you don’t download a virus which is masquerading as an antivirus program \r\n\r\n### 5: Be vigilant while using public WiFI\r\nWhile it could be tempting to update your twitter with a public WIFI, try to resist temptation when it comes to using it for financial transactions. Sometime hackers set up access points and disguise it as public WIFI hotspots.\r\n\r\n### 6: Say bye to Bluetooth\r\nDon’t keep your Bluetooth switched on when you are not using it. Hackers can access many things on your phone with it. \r\n\r\n### 7: Identity theft insurance \r\nThis type of insurance can often be a part of your home insurance policy. This will help you in credit monitoring and also alert you to any potential fraud.

An additional process called diafiltration results in additional carbohydrate removal making it have a high concentration of protein, about 85 per cent, and very little of the fat and lactose that make up natural milk.\r\n\r\nDialfiltered milk is currently being imported into Canada as an ‘ingredient’, allowing it to enter into Canada tariff free. \r\n\r\nThe Canadian government does not charge a tariff on it, because if it were to be dried into a powder, it would have the same amount of protein as the kinds of protein powders allowed to pass through tariff-free under trade agreements. \r\n\r\nHowever, it remains significant that it is not a powder and some food processors do not wish to see it as a powder, rather considering it as milk.

', 'Burnout is a state of emotional, mental, and physical exhaustion which can be caused by excessive and prolonged stress. \r\n\r\nThey usually occur when you feel overwhelmed and unable to meet constant demands, and as the stress continues you began to lose interest in the very things that you enjoyed earlier. \r\n\r\nAs more work-from-home and work-on-the-go options are prevalent, so are the chances of a burnout. A poll found that burnout was one of the top reasons for people to quit jobs and move onto different roles. \r\n\r\nThe American Psychological Association and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago reported that 48 per cent of Americans experienced increased stress over the past 5 years, and 53 per cent say work leaves them “overtired and overwhelmed.”\r\n\r\nBurnout could result when you feel like you are putting in a lot of hard work, but you are not getting the proportional results for it. This happens when a job is not very rewarding and also when you are not taking good care of yourself. \r\n\r\nThese are the main warning signs of burnout, knowing and recognizing these will help to deal with its prevention. \r\n\r\nHealth problems are the number one indicator of a burnout. Burnout has a huge impact on both your physical as well as mental health. If you are experiencing body pains, heart disease, depression or if you feel that you are not as healthy as you would like to be and fall sick often, then you should evaluate the role of your work in your life. You should release that it is time to take a re-look at your career.  \r\n\r\nCognitive difficulties can also be a major indicator, if you feel you are not able to concentrate, are making silly mistakes, forgetting things unnecessarily, or having difficulty making decisions or with the decisions you are making, then you should consider that you are burning out. \r\n\r\nStress makes its way into everything in our life, it changes how we interact with people and deal with situations. If you feel that you are not able to keep your stress under control or that your work stress is now affecting your personal life that your relationships with your near and dear ones will ultimately face the brunt of the ugly stress monster.  Different people deal with stress differently, some do so by alienating their loved others, other yell at them or find they unnecessarily argue. If you find this happening often in your relationships then it is time to take it serious. \r\n\r\nIf you find yourself feeling exhausted a lot, it could be because of burnout. Stress takes a toll both on your body and mind, if you wake up in the morning feeling tired and feel you have no energy to get you through the day, you could be experiencing a burnout. Fatigue is one of the main indicators of a burnout and it is essential know you are just tired after a long days work of this nagging feeling of tiredness just refuses to go away.\r\n\r\nOther signs of a burnout are negativity and decreased levels of satisfaction, are you only looking at the negative aspect of things lately even though you have always been a positive person, chances are you could be experiencing a burnout. A nagging sense of dissatisfaction and very low levels of excitement are also indicators. If you are not satisfied it makes work life very difficult as you feel you are work very hard and not getting any results or reward for the work you are putting in. \r\n\r\nWhen you face a burnout, you will also likely lose your motivation, you may complete your work and even do them well, but you find that you don’t have any motivation to get them done. You often find that you are only doing work because you don’t want to miss deadlines or dead with the consequences of not doing it and not because you truly feel like working. \r\n\r\nThe funny thing is that people who burn out are usually the high achievers, and so you may also notice your performance not being as good as it was earlier. This could lead to self doubt, it is essential to understand this sign as stress burnout. \r\n\r\nAnother indicator is that you find that your self control is not what it used to be, you indulge in things that you previously would not have, you compromise your decision making and self control due to the low levels of confidence you are feeling. \r\n\r\nIf you feel you are experiencing many of these symptoms, then don’t lose hope. There are many ways to deal with a burnout and fight it, here are a few. \r\nYou need a break to discharge and then recharge yourself. Take some time in your daily life when you are disconnected to your work life. Stay away from the computer, the phone and your work emails. On weekends, if you feel that you can’t shut off your work completely allocate certain specific timings for it and stick to those timings for using your electronics. Put your phone away while eating. Find other interesting things to do over the weekend. \r\n\r\nPaying attention to your health and fitness is also very important to preventing a burnout, aches and pains can occur due to stress; train yourself to recognize the symptoms so that you can know when it is time to take a break from it all. Plan a relaxing activity for each say. It could be something simple like a long bath or reading a book but having something to look forward to will make your day a lot better. Another important thing is to stay from sedatives and to let your body sleep when it is ready to, don’t alter your body’s natural process. \r\n\r\nSometimes the stress does not come from having much too work to handle, but rather not being prepared and organized to deal with it all. When you take some time out to organize everything you will feel like you are actually working a lot less. \r\n\r\nDon’t work till you can’t any more, take short breaks throughout the day and be ready to work with more productivity rather than spending a lot of time doing something when you know you are fatigued. \r\n\r\nAsk for help, sometimes asking the people around you for help can be a great way to deal with a burnout, understand that your health is a lot more important than your job.', 0, 21, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'You may love your job, but even that does not stop you from dealing with work related stress that could eventually lead to a burnout.', 'Staff', '', '2016-07-01 04:30:14', '2016-07-01 05:18:21'),

There are actually two ways a restaurant can deal with the tips the staff make. ', 'The first one is to let the staff deal with it themselves, the second method is to “control” what happens to the tip, namely making sure its split among the staff or making it a mandatory charge, or considering it a business income. When the second method is used, the tip can become part of an employee’s official salary and therefore can be subject to all charges that would otherwise be levied on an income such as Canada Pension Plan deductions and employment insurance premiums.\r\n\r\nSo how do restaurants deal with this? According to experts the best way is to follow method one and let the staff deal with the tips themselves, as far as the restaurants do not interfere in the tipping process they don’t have to declare it as part of the restaurant revenues and hence deal with the various surcharges that follow. \r\n\r\n “The key is not to co-mingle the tip money with your restaurant’s revenues,” Paul Hewitt, a Toronto-based chartered professional accountant said. \r\nThe culture of tipping has various rules that could be confusing and cumbersome, many tourists are unaware of the etiquette that govern tips while some Canadians feel that it is time to kill tips altogether. However, it doesn’t look like tips are going anywhere, hence it is important for restaurants to realize that the way they handle tips can have an impact on their payments to the government. \r\n\r\nThe Canada Revenue Agency distinguishes between the two types of tips we mentioned earlier, direct and controlled. Direct tips straight from the customer to the employee, such as cash tips and debit or credit-card tips that are passed back to service staff in cash and aren’t eligible for CPP contributions or Employment Insurance premiums.\r\n\r\nHowever, when an establishment interferes with tips’ distribution it can lead to deductions for both employer and employee.\r\n\r\nThe CRA has in the past said that , “If an employer, for cash flow reasons, delays paying out the tips to the workers, the employer is merely a conduit for the tip from the client to the worker and the tip would still be considered to be direct and would not be subject to CPP and EI deductions.”\r\n\r\nAnother point is that most Auto gratuitie, like those charged to large groups of six or more, are considered “controlled” tips by CRA and are thus eligible for taxation. \r\n\r\nFor the employees, their direct tips are not eligible for CPP contributions or EI premiums, however very few people declare their tips, and even if they do, do not declare it fully. Usually restaurant employees decide at tax time what they will declare and coworkers usually follow this to avoid standing out.', 0, 6, 10, 0, 1, NULL, 'The culture of tipping at restaurants has been prevalent for a long while, customers tip their servers based on how satisfied they are after that meal. \r\nBut how do restaurants deal with tips in their taxes?

Regulators in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick finalized an investment dealer prospectus exemption that allows any investor who has obtained advice about the suitability of the investment from an investment dealer to participate directly in private placements.\r\n\r\nA new offering memorandum exemption was implemented which allows retail investors to be able to invest up to $10,000 into the private capital markets annually in Ontario. The province has also introduced a crowdfunding exemption where companies are now able to raise funds from retail investors publicly online once they register a funding portal with provincial securities regulators. Investors can invest $2,500 per company and up to a maximum of $10,000 total in the same year.\r\n\r\nThese regulations have led some U.S. lenders to make new plans.

That refers to a firm that is able to sell investment securities that haven’t been qualified by a prospectus due to regulatory exemptions. Its Canadian site, investnextdoor.ca, is poised to become the next online marketplace lender for Canadian small businesses looking to raise funds, as well as for investors looking for alternative investment options.\r\n\r\nInvest Next Door is an online marketplace that enables accredited investors to provide loan financing directly to small and medium-sized enterprises in the United States. A peer to business financial platform was launched in May 2014 allowing businesses to create listings where they set rates and terms that investors can then bid upon.  \r\n\r\nIt remains interesting that the company was originally to be founded in Canada, but due to the regulatory environment at the time its founders decided to enter the “more mature” U.S market.\r\n\r\nThe peer-to-peer lending market remains a complex one; it also remains a difficult industry to navigate for new entrants. This could be as usually providers would fund loans exclusively from accredited investor who typically have a net worth of $5 million or $1 million of investable assets or going in for institutional loans.\r\n\r\nLending Loop is another online lender, it launched last fall prior to the new crowdfunding rules, and was the first Canadian provider to allow retail investors access to the private capital market.

Online advertisement sites are filled with deals for phone plans that promise unlimited Canada wide calls, texts and a 5GB data package for only $48 a month.\r\n\r\nHowever these deals are not sold by the mobile phone provider but rather a third party agent who charges a onetime fee as their commission for selling this cheaper deal. Online site Kijiji in Toronto is one such popular place to buy these black-market deals.

The companies only charge $48 a month for the same package in Saskatchewan and Manitoba as the telecom companies face more competition there, rather than the less-competitive Toronto phone market. So these black-market third party sellers apparently secure the cheaper phone plan out of Saskatchewan or Manitoba and then switch over a customer''s phone number from another province. They charge a onetime fee for this transaction which could range from $40 to $150.\r\n\r\n> ### Most experts feel that the high prices of cellular service in most provinces are the reason that the underground business is flourishing. People are always looking for a better deal and do not mind the risks associated to buying deals in the black market, experts said.  \r\n\r\nExperts also point out that telecom companies could be hesitant to crack down on these plans as it could lead to negative publicity, the debate on expensive phone plans is one that consumers will be happy to bring up. \r\n\r\nAs long as phone plans remain cheap in Saskatchewan, both the third party dealers and the consumer flocking to them remain happy. \r\n\r\nSpokespersons of telecom companies have cautioned customers against using these deals and that sharing personal information could result in fraud.\r\n\r\n## Toronto Cell Phone Deals\r\nIf you''re looking for other options, whether a Toronto phone deal or for the best cell phone plans in Vancouver  consider looking at websites like [whistleout.ca](https://www.whistleout.ca/CellPhones), or  [planhub.ca](http://www.planhub.ca/ontario/compare-cellphone-plan).

', 'While prices of houses in major Canadian cities soar, many millennials have been finding it increasingly difficult to find affordable housing. \r\nReal estate prices have risen even in outskirts of cities and areas where they have remained traditionally lower thus making it very difficult for potential buyers to purchase their much needed house.\r\n\r\nAverage house prices are around $1.1 million in the greater Vancouver area and have risen up to $700,00 in Toronto. Places surrounding the cities are facing steep increases too and areas like Scarborough, Ontario are now expensive for a potential home owner. \r\n\r\nMillennials are looking for alternatives, some are sharing their house with house guests or renting out rooms to students to make up for the large prices they have to pay. \r\n\r\nThe average price of a house has doubled in the Greater Toronto Area over the past 7 years, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association. In Vancouver too prices have doubled, according to CREA.\r\n\r\nWhile the real estate prices have steadily increased, the people paying for the houses have not received a proportionate increase in income. An average person’s income has only increased 15 percent over the past 7 years, in comparison to housing prices which have doubled. This makes it very difficult for older people to enter the housing market as first time owners. \r\n\r\nWhile renting out rooms and hosting paying-houseguests are some alternatives that millennial are opting for, many of them are bidding farewell to the big cities and heading to other parts. Millennials find it much more lucrative to find new jobs or work from home options rather than shelling out big dollars for unaffordable housing.  \r\n\r\nStatscan’s latest intraprovincial migration data gives us a glimpse into this, Toronto has lost the highest number of young people since 1999-2000 and Vancouver has lost the most since the Great Recession. The data shows that millennials are moving to areas outside Toronto and Vancouver, such as Oshawa and [Barrie](/article/barrie-real-estate-information) in Ontario and Kelowna in British Columbia.\r\n\r\nHowever the trend has led to a spike in prices in these areas as well, it has become much more expensive but still remain lower than the cities making it significantly easier on millennials. \r\n\r\nRegions surrounding Toronto face the same issue, [In Barrie, the price of an average house has almost doubled](http://www.maximumventure.ca/article/barrie-real-estate-information) to $403,019 over the past six years, according to CREA. In Hamilton, prices have jumped 55 per cent to $483,281. \r\n\r\nTaking out mortgages has become easier in spite of these rising real estate prices as low interest rates have made it easier on loan seekers. More first time home buyers are now millennials than earlier.

The attacks were seen as a clash between the industry worker past and gentrifying present of the area. \r\n\r\nGentrification is a controversial topic in urban planning which refers to shifts in an urban community lifestyle and an increasing share of wealthier residents and businesses. This could lead to increasing property values and the displacing of lower-income families and small businesses\r\nIn the recent past, shops and businesses that represented this new trend of gentrification have faced backlash, they have had their merchandise stolen by vandals, graffiti spray painted, and windows smashed. \r\n \r\nThe residents of the area once worked at the factories in the nearby areas, however in the past few decades industries have moved away to less expensive areas far away and even overseas in some cases. This led to the neighborhood remaining relatively poor with not enough jobs for everyone, rent remained low and the area had a large percentage of people who lived in poverty. \r\n\r\nHowever as times evolved, the area saw a greater mix of more working families with children who are ready to buy things that are not available in the newer shops.  \r\n\r\n> ### “What somebody calls gentrification, somebody else calls growth and evolution”\r\n\r\n“What somebody calls gentrification, somebody else calls growth and evolution,” Ryan Bloom, an entrepreneur told a news organization recently. Bloom, who used to work for real estate development firm Live Work Learn Play in economically depressed downtown districts across the U.S. and Canada, said the term gentrification carries negative connotations.\r\n\r\nOther entrepreneurs too echo his sentiments; new entrepreneurs are stepping up to make the area safer, they feel. The new businesses are bringing jobs to the neighborhood, with 90 per cent of the employees being from the same area. \r\n\r\n“We are employing the people who live in St-Henri, employing them well and giving them full-time, very good paying jobs and no one is talking about that.” One employer said. \r\n\r\nCity councillor for St-Henri, Craig Sauvé, recently told a news organization that while he condemns the attacks on businesses, he believes gentrification is a problem in the neighborhood. Small businesses have been forced out the neighborhood as they can no longer afford the rent. \r\n\r\nThe entrepreneurs added that they are unable to debate with the anti-gentrification protestors because they don’t know who is behind it, and that no arrests have been made regarding the attacks but that they will continue running their businesses in the same way.', 0, 16, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'Entrepreneurs at Montreal feel that a discussion on how their businesses are brining benefits to the community is missing and people are instead focusing on rising rents and the new shops that offer higher priced products in what was a traditionally working class area.', 'Staff', '', '2016-07-08 23:10:55', '2016-07-09 15:37:07'),

Investment scams can come out of the blue...', 'http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1671233/images/o-INVESTMENT-FRAUD-facebook.jpg', 'You work hard for your money and the last thing you want is to be swindled by a con artist or financial scammer. ', 'Investment scams can come out of the blue, they are usually just what they sound like, and you are convinced to deposit money in what is shown to be a clever investment which in reality doesn’t exist.  \r\n\r\n**Here are 7 investment scams you should know about and stay far away from:**\r\n\r\n### Advance fee scheme\r\nThis is a widely seen scam; the victim is convinced to invest in an offer which promises a lucrative return. The scammer takes the investment and vanishes to never be seen again. These scams rely on victims paying up large sums on money in advance, the scammers suggest that the offer is valid only for a short duration and will not be available at a later date.  \r\n\r\n### Exempt securities scam\r\nExempt securities are those that may be sold without a prospectus, but are limited to accredited investors or certain other conditions. This makes for a very believable scam and scammers pitch fraudulent investments as ‘exempt’ securities. In reality, not all exempt securities are scams, but it is very important to be highly vigilant if you are offered an exempt security.  The scammer may present the investment as one that is only available to wealthy people and may make you misrepresent your net worth, don’t fall prey to this.  \r\n\r\n### Forex scam\r\nTrading in foreign exchange is seen as a very risky trade, and the forex market is considered to be the largest and most liquid financial market in the world. This scam can take advantage of the lack of information people posses about the forex trade and lure victims into investing in the scam.  Some forex trading schemes may be illegal; they may take your money and not invest it where they claim to. Be alert if you are asked to wire money into an offshore account before you can start forex trading. As a general rule for all type of investments, do not send your money into offshore accounts, even if they claim that is the only way to invest. \r\n\r\n### Offshore investing scam\r\nOffshore investing is a term that should put you on high alert to know that the investment could be a fake. Do not fall for tax avoidance schemes even if they promise huge profits. Remember that if something sounds too good to be true it means something is not right. Also remember that if you send your money to another country in ‘offshore investing’ you cannot sue the person in a court in Canada making it impossible to recover your money. \r\n\r\n### Pension scam\r\nThe word pension can bring to your mind a comfortable old age, but beware of pension scams. These scams target people who have their retirement savings in a Locked-In Retirement Account. The scam promises to sanction a special “RRSP loan” that lets you get around the tax laws and tap into your locked-in funds. To avail the loan, you would have to sell the investments you hold in your retirement account and use the money to buy shares of a start-up company they suggest. In return, the scammer promises to loan you back part of the money you invested while they keep the rest as a fee. You may be told you will receive the amount as cash and will have to pay not tax on it all while holding a valuable investment in your retirement account. But the investment in the supposed startup company could be worthless and the loan you were promised will not arrive either. In short you lose your retirement savings.  These scams are sometimes promoted in newspaper advertisements, stay far away from them. \r\n\r\n### Ponzi or pyramid scheme\r\nPonzi or pyramid schemes are gaining more popularity but people are now becoming wiser too.  The scams recruit people through advertisements, emails and word of mouth and promise to help people make huge money from working at home, or making a special investment. Do not fall for these schemes even if the person inducting you is something you know and trust chances are they too are a victim and don’t realize this is a scam.  The scammers could even pay you an initial “return” to make the scam appear more realistic and then get you to invest more money. These returns are paid out when new people join the scheme and eventually when the scam runs its course the scammers vanish with everything they made. \r\n\r\n### Pump and dump scam\r\nThis is a stock market related scam where scammers contact potential investors to promote what seems to be an incredible deal on a low priced stock. In reality the scammer holds large amounts of this stock and as more investors buy this stock the value rises, once the stock prices hits a peak, the scammer sells his stock and vanishes. You are left with a pile of worthless stock and think you just made a bad judgment when in reality you were scammed.\r\n\r\n**See also: [How to Spot Real Estate Scams](/article/how-to-spot-a-real-estate-scam)**', 0, 10, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'You work hard for your money and the last thing you want is to be swindled by a con artist or financial scammer.

Work experience in both web design and hospitality has given them a step up in the restaurant guide and review market. Their site has gone on to become much more than the restaurant guide it started off as and now has most of its business being generated through the software and websites they create for clients.\r\n\r\n### How has the website changed since you first launched it?\r\nWe started it as a restaurant guide for the public and it wasn’t originally meant to a business. However the success of the site went on to make us more like a software company building marketing tools and software solutions for restaurants and the hospitality industry. While the guide remains one part of the business, the bigger part is the software development offered to restaurants. \r\n\r\nThere is no unnecessary clutter or "information overload" which can be found on other sites. We also have a firm understanding of the power of editorial content and a firm grasp of modern culture combine to provide content unique in both look and depth. \r\n\r\nSoftware created by the team includes a new gen VIP calling card that uses a tablet to take down information from clients about their experiences. This data can be seen over time to compare performance.\r\n\r\n### How has Dine.TO been so successful in Toronto and done better than its competitors? \r\nJust the strong technology we have created to help restaurants market themselves is something that nobody does. There is not one thing that leads to the success of the site. We have encompassed all the things that other sites to and then some. Each one of the competitor websites has their own niche, but we have brought together everything that all these other sites can do. We also house the info from the sites we make on Dine TO so we have all the menus with their photos from each restaurant. Quality content and good, non-biased reviews also ensure that people come back to read. We work with the best food critics and editors so our readers can trust our content. We also send out a newsletter every week so our readers can find out about the new hot restaurant that have opened.\r\n<a style="display:block;text-align:center" href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/dc100wktqks7G9B999A799DGFAGA79CEAHFHGDC888" target="_blank" onmouseover="window.status=''http://www.groupon.com?z=dealpage'';return true;" onmouseout="window.status='' '';return true;">Save 70% or more on new deals near you</a><img src="http://www.tqlkg.com/r975uuymsqBKDFDDDEBDDHKJEKEBDGIELJLKHGCCC" width="1" height="1" border="0"/>\r\n\r\n### How is a restaurant chosen for a review? \r\nThe writer chooses the restaurant. The most important factor is that it has to be new; we don’t review restaurants that have remained open for years. Our readers look forward to new and fresh content and want to remain updated about the latest restaurant in town. The opinion of the writer decides the review’s content.  \r\n\r\n### Are you opening in other cities? \r\nWe are already in [Barrie](/article/barrie-real-estate-information), Mississauga, and other locations in Ontario. We have been in [Montreal](/tag/montreal) for the past few years and in Edmonton for the past 7 years. Our goal this year is to go to [Vancouver](/tag/vancouver), [Calgary](/tag/calgary), and other big Canadian cities. Once we have done that our next step will be to go down south.\r\n\r\n### How do you plan your tours and videos? \r\nWe use our in house photographers and videographers; we also have a full fleet of programmers.\r\n\r\n### Do you organize or sponsor any events? \r\nSponsoring food related and restaurant driven events has allowed us to get more involved with the community and helped us stay in touch with restaurants we work with while opening up the doors to those that we don’t work with yet. \r\n\r\n### Your home base is Toronto, what is your favourite thing about working in Toronto? \r\nThe diversity, we have worked with many restaurants of many cuisines and ethnicities. This makes work more interesting and fun.  We left Montreal because it was economically better to come to Toronto. Toronto is a great city for young entrepreneurs and is very vibrant and energetic place. \r\n\r\n### What are your future projects?\r\nWe have many interesting projects lined up.

The data shows the number of senior citizens still working has increased by 62 per cent in the past decade. This means that one out of every eight people over 65 still works compared with one in every 13 seniors who worked a decade ago. \r\n\r\nFor some seniors it is the love for their job that keeps them working, however many others admit that they are working as they need to make money to pay their bills. \r\n\r\nSelf employed people are most likely to postpone their retirement; this also has to do with the fact that they don’t have pension plans or benefits. \r\nMost seniors who are continuing to work feel that the pay makes sure they can maintain their independence and not worry about money. \r\n\r\nSome people who have retired have later gone back into the workforce when they realize they are financially deficient. \r\n\r\nLisa Taylor, founder and president of Challenge Factory, launched a business that provides mentoring for the older generation in a career change. \r\n\r\n"Organizations count people out too early," said Taylor.

', 'The federal government will finalize the agreement by July 15 of this year and the new premiums will be collected from workers and employers starting in January 2019. \r\n\r\nRead on to find out what this means for the average Canadian worker. \r\n\r\n### Premiums \r\nWondering what will happen to your premiums? Under the new plan, CPP will replace fully one-third of a person''s pre-retirement income (up from the current 25 per cent replacement rate) up to a maximum amount of earnings that will also rise.\r\n\r\nCurrently, a worker and his or her employer each contribute 4.95 per cent of the worker''s income annually, on earnings between $3,500 and $54,900 a year, to the plan.\r\n\r\nThat will change with a one percentage point hike to premiums (up to 5.95 per cent each) phased in over five years, starting in 2019. By the time the higher premium is fully phased in, in 2024, a worker earning $50,000 annually will pay roughly $25 a month more in premiums or $296 more a year.\r\n\r\nThat will be followed by an increase in the maximum pensionable earnings level to $82,700 from $54,900, phased in over two years, meaning higher-income earners will pay further premiums but will stand to receive even higher retirement benefits.\r\n\r\nThe CPP premium on income between $54,900 and the new maximum, $82,700, will be lower and is expected to be 4.0 per cent rather than 5.95 a major news organization reported. \r\n\r\n### Benefits \r\nThere will be changes to benefits as well. A middle-income Canadian entering the workforce now who earns an average of $50,000 a year would receive a pension of $16,000 a year in retirement, instead of the $12,000 allocated under the current regime, according to Finance Canada.\r\nBut current retirees will receive no additional money. It is younger workers, who will contribute the higher rate for longer, who stand to gain the most when they eventually reach retirement age.\r\n\r\nAnd with the significant increase to maximum pensionable earnings after 2025, higher income Canadians will receive higher benefits in the future.\r\n\r\n### What about lower income people? \r\nThere was concern that a premium increase would hurt lower income Canadians and that for a relatively small increase in retirement benefits they would have to shell out big dollars during their working years. However the federal government has agreed to expand an existing refundable tax credit known as the working income tax benefit (WITB) to offset the higher premiums\r\n\r\nThe federal government has agreed to expand an existing refundable tax credit known as the working income tax benefit (WITB) to offset the higher premiums. The maximum payout for that program is currently $1,800 for a family earning less than $28,000 a year.\r\nFor higher income earners, the premium on the income above $54,900 will be tax deductible with taxpayers being able to “write off” the payments during tax time. \r\n\r\n### No Special “Ontario” plan \r\nOntario''s pension plan, which was almost finalized and set to roll out in 2018, will now be scrapped. The enhanced CPP will be less generous than the proposed Ontario retirement pension plan, which would have imposed higher premiums and delivered more benefits, a further $2,000 a year, roughly, for the average worker earning $50,000 a year.', 0, 10, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'The new hike in the Canada Pension Plan means that they will collect more money to provide support later in retirement.

The negotiations were concluded in August 2014 with the agreement to be approved by the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament and potentially all EU member states.

Due to the economic uncertainty which Brexit has sparked off, there is speculation the Bank of England could soon cut interest rates. The U.S which was looking to hike rates in September may delay the plan. \r\n\r\nCanadian interest rates are expected to remain low for an even longer period. This could be a bane for the housing markets in many Canadian cities which are already becoming out of reach for many people. \r\n\r\nWhile property prices may rise, it could only be due to the struggling global economy which could hurt the housing market in the long run. \r\nSo are we sure there won’t be a recession? \r\n\r\nExperts feel that Brexit makes the global growth outlook appear dim at the moment. The real concern would be if other European countries choose to follow Britain''s lead and flee the EU, which could cause great uncertainty and could potentially lead to an unraveling of the European Union. \r\nMost economists have their eyes trained on EU now. Brexit could also hamper growth in the global economy and the Canadian economy for a short while. \r\n\r\n## Canadian businesses \r\nCanadian companies doing direct business with the UK will feel the most direct and immediate fallout.

Many millennials are overlooking sales jobs and employment firms find that employers take more time to fill sales positions compared to other jobs. ', 'While it can be easy for baby boomers to blame millennials as being not very good in sales and unable to handle rejection, that is actually far from the truth. Turns out millennials actually have potential to be great salespeople, according to some experts their aversion to cold calling which has now become a traditional selling strategy could prove to be way to increase sales. \r\n\r\nCold calling is defined as the solicitation of business from potential customers who have had no prior contact with the salesperson. Cold calling is used to attempt to convince potential customers to purchase either the salesperson’s product or service and is generally referred to as an over-the-phone process, making it a source of telemarketing.\r\n\r\nThough cold calling can be used as a legitimate business tool, scammers can use cold calling as well, making people more suspicious of such calls. \r\nAs cold calling became more common so did the people who found them irritating and refused to pick up calls from unknown numbers. \r\n\r\nAccording to a study by market intelligence firm [InsideView](https://blog.insideview.com/2011/03/18/the-death-of-cold-calling-ending-the-debate/), 90% of high-level executives never respond to cold calls or e-mail blasts. It is not difficult to guess why, millennials understand this only too well. They too hate receiving cold calls.  \r\n\r\nMillennials are armed with other skill set that could help them in sales. Being social media savvy could also help them market better. Their reputation of being “over sharers” has actually helped them be more effective in sales. \r\n\r\nThis strategy is referred to as ‘inbound selling’ and it involves making yourself visible so customers contact you first. This strategy is popular among tech startups but has been slow to catch on with traditional businesses.\r\n\r\nThe role of a salesperson has evolved with the times, they are no longer expected to go out and find the opportunity, rather bring customers who are already engaged across the goal line. \r\n\r\nExperts also say that cold calling is not entirely dead. But that here are many other options to reach a customer now than to interrupt their day with a telephone call. \r\n\r\nCompanies need to adapt themselves to the customers of today and invest in inbound marketing, in a good website and make sure they are present on social media. All of these could be a much better way of attracting people to buy your product or service rather than making random cold calls throughout the day, many of which will go unanswered.', 0, 21, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'It looks like millennials now feel that cold calling is no longer a viable sales tactic.

Here''s a list of five things to help you decide.', 'Here''s five things to think about before applying for an MBA programme:\r\n\r\n### Have you decided what program you want to apply for? \r\nYou have now decided to apply for an MBA, the first thing is to chose the type of program you are interested in. Do you want a full time program or an executive program? Full time MBA programs will require you to be present full time and cater to students, who may not have much of experience of business track record. Executive MBAs on the other hand allow students to complete the program while working. However students who apply for executive MBA programs usually have more business experience and most schools require this as well. Another thing to consider before choosing the type of program you would prefer is to think of your present job and what you expect to do after the MBA. Deciding how much time you can afford to take away from the working world is another way to gauge the program you should choose. \r\n\r\n### Location of the school \r\nIt is important to know what you expect to do after your MBA when you choose the location of the school. If you intend to stay in Canada after your MBA, then it does not really make sense to attend school in the U.S or Europe. However if you are looking to move outside the country then starting with an MBA program at the country of your choice could be a great way to move there and get acclimatized to the working environment and build a professional network there. \r\n\r\n### What type of companies are you planning to work at after the MBA?\r\nMany people choose schools based on the companies that recruit there. This is a very important factor to consider when choosing your school. Do some basic research to find out which schools the company you are looking into is recruiting from. Knowing which companies recruit at the schools make it easier for you to choose. \r\n\r\n### What are your chances of getting in? \r\nYour GMAT score is one of the main things that could decide whether you can make it into a particular school. Most business schools publish the average GMAT score of successful applicants, along with the range. It is important to get within 20 points of the average or be prepared to give a satisfactory explanation to the admissions officer. \r\n\r\n### Go with your gut instinct \r\nIt is never a bad idea to follow your gut instinct when it comes to choosing a school. Every school is unique and when you walk in you may be able to know whether you fit in or not. Use this information to make a decision. Most experts recommend visiting schools, meeting with admissions and alumni officers, and talking to students and other people at the school to decide the best school for you.', 0, 10, 21, 0, 1, NULL, 'Looking for an MBA programme?

However the protests dint stop the bill, the house passed with the assent of Liberal and Conservative MPs and it became law in a short while. \r\n\r\nIn the present day Barbados takes the Number 3 spot for Canadian money going abroad behind the U.S and U.K. More than $80 billion dollars has been moved to Barbados by wealthy Canadians and companies over the years. There is more Canadian money parked in the tiny island of Barbados than Germany, Italy, Franc e Japan and Russia put together.  \r\n\r\nBarbados is where Canadians first started their offshore, legal tax avoidance. Big companies have had affiliates there for years and Canadian banks have had their branches there too. It became like an entrance to an offshore network and companies created subsidiaries there just to help them transfer money. \r\n\r\nAnother main reason that Barbados was preferred was the corporate tax rate, which was lower than 2.5 percent. Once the small amount was paid any profits earned at a subsidiary on the island could be brought back to Canada tax-free. \r\n\r\n<a style="text-align: center;margin: 1em auto;display: block;" href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/q7105mu2-u1HQJLJJJKHJIOMNOLMHJMMRKPPNQNIII?sid=travel+tips+article" target="_blank" onmouseover="window.status=''http://www.expedia.com'';return true;" onmouseout="window.status='' '';return true;">\r\n<img src="http://www.lduhtrp.net/hb66m-3sywHQJLJJJKHJIOMNOLMHJMMRKPPNQNIII" alt="" border="0"/></a>\r\n\r\nCanadian companies are not the only ones going the tax haven route, Apple routes its non U.S profits through Ireland into the British Virgin Islands, and Google’s choice haven is Bermuda.

Apache Corp, which is based in Houston, has asked some senior staff to extend their career even past their retirement age. It also has a three year professional development program for new hires. The demographics are interesting, one half of the company’s staff are younger than 36 while a third is over 50. \r\n\r\nThe main reason for the gap is that there was a period between 1985 and 2000 when not many people entered the industry as it was then seen as bad career choice. But this mass retirement is coming at a time when the oil sector is already low on talent.  Worldwide, oil and natural gas companies have cut more than 350,000 jobs since crude prices started to fall in 2014, according to a report by Houston-based consultant Graves & Co.\r\n\r\nThe industry employed around 1.4 million people last year, according to the American Petroleum Institute.

However many of these companies don’t reach where they intend to. Should start up companies be focusing more on how to market and making money rather than raising the investment they need?', 'Recently Justin Thouin of LowestRates.ca wrote an article for a major news organization where he said companies should start with relatively lesser seed money and focus more on becoming profitable instead. \r\n\r\nHe feels that while it is not feasible for all companies to start with relatively little seed money and become profitable it was possible for his company. Many ventures require costly infrastructure or technology to get the ball rolling and that there is no one-size-fits-all solution in business, he adds. \r\n“When I started my rate comparison site, [LowestRates.ca](http://www.lowestrates.ca/), we chose to not raise huge sums of money. Instead, we launched the platform with $150,000 and told ourselves if we run out, we’re done. We bootstrapped and focused on selling our vision to customers, not investors. Here’s why it worked for us, and why it might work for you too,” Thouin said in the article. \r\n\r\nStarting with a set amount can be the best way; it will not only drive you to be more creative and resourceful but also find ways to acquire customers. You would be forced to prove your business since you don’t have a safety net and that can be great for a business. \r\n\r\n> ### “When I started my rate comparison site, LowestRates.ca, we chose to not raise huge sums of money. Instead, we launched the platform with $150,000 and told ourselves if we run out, we’re done.” <small>Justin Thouin of LowestRates.ca</small>\r\n\r\nFor example Thouin says he acquired customer through search engine optimization which is not as expensive as other traditional marketing methods. However it does require expertise and patience but can bring in good results. The result of the SEO was a profitable customer base and that is something no amount of seed funding can buy.\r\n \r\nIn the startup world bootstrapping means starting a business without external help or capital and is a great way for companies to come into their own. However bootstrapping is not easy, there are many hurdles that will have to be crossed and it is not the glamorous world of startups like most people imagine. \r\n\r\nIt can be difficult no one knows about your company and you don’t have substantial marketing funds to get the word around. You can often find yourself working for numerous hours without any substantial results. The most important thing is do believe in yourself and do what you believe will help you in the long run. If your business model is successful you will find yourself being thankful for not going overboard with the funding in the early days\r\nRaising funds can be helpful in many ways, not only can it get things moving faster it can also generate media attention, motivate staff and bring in new partnerships but not all companies require huge investments right at the beginning. So it is very important for the entrepreneur to make sure they are taking the right decisions regarding funding and not getting drawn into just generating funds and neglecting the main purpose of the business.\r\n \r\nThe best way to do this is to remember that when you are getting funded, they expect something in return, and most often it is stock. This means that you are giving up a part of the company that could have been yours when the business is doing well. Ask yourself if using the funding now is worth losing a piece of the company in the long run. \r\n\r\nWhen some companies are more focused on raising the money and keeping their investors satisfied they are not as focused on making money and satisfying customers which is very important for the business and the reputation of the company.  \r\n\r\nWhile bootstrapping may seem really difficult at first it will help your control your own future. You do have to deal with more risk but remember that you also get to make the decisions. Sure, you may have less money right away but that means there will be pressure for your business model to get better and you will be able to retain bigger parts of your company. \r\n\r\nWhile bootstrapping is the best choice for some it may not be for all, the decision is yours to take but remember that patience, confidence and dedication will go a long way no matter which route you choose.', 0, 18, 10, 0, 1, NULL, 'In the age of Kickstarter, some companies are raising huge amounts of money to start up.

Over the next decade it''s expected to have all-day Go Train service as well.\r\n\r\nNewmarket''s history can be traced back to a portage route between Lake Ontario and Lake Simcoe in the early 1700s, over the years it gained a sizable population from Quaker families who had left their homes in Vermont and Pennsylvania ahead of the American revolution, and later played a central role in William Lyon Mackenzie''s Rebellion of 1837. \r\n\r\nAs well as Go Train service, Newmarket is served by York Regional Transit and the Viva bus network, including a rapid bus service now under construction. \r\n\r\nIn 2013, MoneySense magazine ranked Newmarket in its "Canada''s Best Places" feature number 10 out of 200 Canadian cities and 4th in their Top 10 Small Canadian Cities.\r\n\r\nWebsite: [Newmarket.ca](http://www.newmarket.ca/) \r\n\r\n**See also: [TREB Must Provide Home Sales Data Online: Competition Tribunal](/article/treb-must-provide-home-sales-data-online)**\r\n\r\n### Newmarket Advantages\r\n* Green community LEED Platinum subdivision and with 44km of trails\r\n* Healthcare at the Southlake Regional Health Centre\r\n* Easy access to all major highways, a skilled workforce and supportive business environment\r\n* Low crime rates\r\n* Over 6,500 recreation programs and more than 300 special events\r\n* Advanced transit network currently under construction\r\n\r\n## Newmarket Real Estate\r\n\r\n### Real Estate Outlook\r\n* For houses, Newmarket is the 72th most expensive in Ontario with a average price of $750,000 (June 2016); the median for Ontario is $369,900 as of June.\r\n\r\nLinks: [newmarket.realestatebay.ca](http://newmarket.realestatebay.ca/statistics.htm), [canadianrealestatemagazine.ca](http://www.canadianrealestatemagazine.ca/top-neighbourhoods/newmarket-on-570.aspx)\r\n\r\n### In The News\r\n* [Housing Market Remains Difficult for Millennials](http://www.maximumventure.ca/article/housing-market-remains-difficult-for-millennials)\r\n* [Toronto’s hot housing market drives big bidding wars in suburbs](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/the-market/torontos-hot-housing-market-drives-big-bidding-wars-in-suburbs/article29053048/)\r\n\r\n### Brokers and Real Estate Agents Newmarket\r\n* [RoyalLepage.ca](http://www.royallepage.ca/en/on/newmarket/properties)\r\n* [Century21.ca](http://www.century21.ca/CA/ON/Newmarket)\r\n* [KWRealtyCentres.com](http://www.kwrealtycentres.com/newmarket-listings)\r\n* [ReMax.ca](http://www.remax.ca/on/re-max-realtron-realty-inc-newmarket-6631-br/)\r\n\r\n### Newmarket Real Estate Lawyers\r\n* [J Allan Law](http://jallanlaw.com/services/estate-litigation/)\r\n* [Sheldon L.

In spite of Canada’s links to both Britain and the U.S. it is confidently different from both these countries. What is the brand identity Canadians celebrate on July 1? Is it just one of the others? Is it just red serge, maple syrup, beavers and of polite, beer-drinking hockey fans that people identify with? \r\n\r\nWhile it can be nostalgic and even comfortable to identify with those things, it is not a complete picture of the Canada of 2016. We are now a brand that is evolving before our very eyes as the country is growing. We are more different than the stereotypes that had been used to identify us. Hockey is not even Canada’s most popular game anymore.\r\n\r\nWhile the nostalgia can be comfortable it is not what the Canadian brand is about anymore. We are now evolving into much more. According to Statistics Canada, more adults in Canada play golf while more kids are playing soccer than hockey. Basketball and baseball matches are drawing television ratings that only hockey could receive earlier. \r\n\r\nEarlier it was the picturesque mountains and prairie fields which was often the identity that Canada had, even that is changing now. Most Canadians now live in cities and their suburbs rather than in the log cabins that people once pictured. It is not only the geography that is associated with us that has changed, one in every five Canadians are foreign born, bringing with them a distinct identity that increases the diversity of the country. \r\n\r\nThe things that were stereotypes once don’t really reflect the Canadian experience in 2016. As the Canadian experience changes, the brand of the country too has changed along with what we stand for as a nation. \r\n\r\nWe are now being defined by our progressive outlook and no longer considered the quirky Canadians by friends from the U.S. We are no longer being identified by not being like the U.S, rather being understood for what we are rather than what we aren’t.\r\n\r\nWhile advertising and marketing does still sometimes rely on the old stereotypes, there has been a shift and we are now been shown as a progressive, pluralistic, modern society. As these changes are becoming more prominent, we should not leave behind an idyllic past; there should be an identity crisis where people feel they don’t belong anymore. The Brexit vote revealed one such identity crisis where a huge part of the demographic was looking at the past and wanted to reject the changes they were seeing. \r\n\r\nThe complexity of Canada’s brand value is what we should be focusing on rather than the stereotypes.

The country has sent a significant number of astronauts to space and the close relationship with NASA has been an asset. Bob Thirsk was our first to go up into space and lived up there for almost six months and holds the Canadian record for the longest space flight, he was later followed by Chris Hadfield. \r\n\r\nChris Hadfield, in his article, also touched upon his views on the privatization of the space industry. “The big deal is who the customer is, and it has always been governments,” he said adding “Elon Musk is exactly the same as Boeing or Howard Hughes—a government contractor.”\r\n\r\nThe new thing would be finding customers besides a government. In a human space flight it has only been Russia which has been able to fly private citizens to space. However, now Richard Branson is looking to make a business of private space travel for the price of a luxury car. The market for this could be bigger than it looks. \r\n\r\nPolitics also plays a major role in many significant projects being killed over the years, Hadfield said. “How do you sustain funding for something for two-and-a-half political cycles? You need to somehow tie the program to something larger than politics.” He wrote. The only way to deal with the issue is through an international, intergovernmental agreement that each country’s politics can’t back out of. \r\n\r\nThe country’s logical next step is to reach the moon; China is taking the endeavor seriously and is using all technology available to catch-up. It has already landed a rover in space. Russia too is already working closely with the Chinese in this endeavor. An international consortium to put a human base on the moon would make a big difference. \r\n\r\nHowever, according to experts including Hadfield, Canada has to deal with many problems before it reaches the moon. We need to decide whether we are going to become experts in fuel cells, navigation, power generation, radiation protection or communication. There is also crew training to deal with. The project has a long term schedule; it is a 50 year project and is a recognizable part of Canadian technology for the world. \r\n\r\nHadfield’s reason for why Canadians don’t trumpet their space achievements more is a touching one. “It’s not our nature, and maybe it’s part of how we’ve been so successful, because we don’t spend time trumpeting it; we spend time actually doing it.” He said.', 0, 5, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'The Canadian space sector has a world class reputation in various areas.

It often considered the gateway to cottage country, being within a 20 minute drive Collingwood, Blue Mountain and Wasaga Beach. \r\n\r\nThe city itself sits right on Lake Simcoe. It''s named after Sir Robert Barrie, who was in charge of the naval forces in Canada during and after the War of 1812 where the city played a crucial role keeping the future country free, serving as a supply depot for British and allied forces.\r\n\r\nFrom Toronto, it''s less than an hour''s drive north on highway 400 and both Go Bus and Go Trains service the city during the weekdays; Go Trains will provide hourly (30-minute during rush hours) all-day service within in the next 10 years - a boon to those who dread winter driving. In the city itself, Barrie Transit provides bus service for most of the city.\r\n\r\n### Why Barrie, Ontario is very appealing for home buyers now \r\n\r\nBarrie, located on the western shore of Lake Simcoe, is becoming a real estate dream. The city now has a ‘heated’ real estate market and is increasingly becoming more popular among home buyers looking for a resale later while being able to enjoy everything the city has to offer now. \r\n\r\nBarrie is also the second safest city in Canada, which makes it an attractive choice for families and elders. According to data from Statistics Canada, the Crime Severity Index, which measures the volume as well as the seriousness of each crime in comparison to others, is lower than most other places in the country.  \r\n\r\nA lower crime rate can be beneficial in other ways including lower municipal and land taxes due to lesser spending on law enforcement.  \r\n\r\nFirst time buyers, who have been finding it difficult to enter the real estate market, consider purchasing a home in Barrie a good investment option while staying within driving distance to the city. \r\n\r\n<p style="font-weight: bold;text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/10107uoxuowBKDFDDDEBDCIJFCGFBDGIKKIEFGICCC" target="_blank" onmouseover="window.status=''https://orders.freedomvoice.com/secure-order?utm_term=800-numbers'';return true;" onmouseout="window.status='' '';return true;">Get an 800 number</a> and try it FREE for 30 days!<img src="http://www.ftjcfx.com/ef103ltxlrpAJCECCCDACBHIEBFEACFHJJHDEFHBBB" width="1" height="1" border="0" data-pagespeed-url-hash="4241178305" onload="pagespeed.CriticalImages.checkImageForCriticality(this);"/></p>\r\n\r\nEstate agents now advertise buying a property in Barrie as ‘a ticket to making money’. This is actually working as buyers looking to lease their house or looking to sell for a profit are making a bee-line to Barrie looking for some extra cash flow and maybe an extra income for the future years. \r\n\r\nThere are three main types of homes available in Barrie, condos, homes and multi-family homes. The demand remains high across the selection. Single family homes are highly valued but can remain unoccupied for extended periods of time if the owner chooses not to live in Barrie. Au-contraire, condos and multifamily homes, while not as pricey as detached homes, can be easier to lease-out and shared facilities can help make the condo more attractive to someone on a budget. \r\n\r\n**See also: [TREB Must Provide Home Sales Data Online: Competition Tribunal](/article/treb-must-provide-home-sales-data-online)**\r\n\r\nIf you are choosing a property in Barrie to invest in, it is important you analyze the purpose of the purchase before buying. The size of your family and whether you are going to be a permanent resident should be the key factors you consider while making your decision. \r\n\r\nBuying a water front home is a major attraction of purchasing a home in Barrie. Regardless where the house is located there are many things to consider while deciding to buy a waterfront home. Access to the water is always considered a premium sale in real estate and if you are a boat owner look for the presence of a dock for easy access to the water. If the dock is absent then check to see how far the nearest marina is and how far the nearest beach is. \r\n\r\nDon’t hesitate to ask your real estate agent many questions and clear up any doubts you may had, don’t assume anything. Ask about dock licenses and marina requirements before you make the deal to buy a waterfront house. \r\n\r\nAsk for specific survey details to get a clear idea where the property ends and the shore line begins, again as stated before, don’t assume anything. \r\n\r\nWebsites: \r\n* [Barrie.ca](http://www.barrie.ca/)\r\n* [TourismBarrie.com](http://www.tourismbarrie.com/)\r\n* [Barrie restaurants guide](http://www.simcoedining.com)\r\n\r\n### Barrie Advantages:\r\n- Location: It''s a short drive to highways with access to the rest of the GTA (Mississauga, Vaughn, Toronto, Newmarket)\r\n- Recreation: Barrie sits right on the waterfront, there''s several beaches, boating, parks (over 300 hectares).

The economic downturn across the globe has led to this, a recent report by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants said. \r\n\r\nAccountants can help management make decisions that would directly affect their business’ success in risky economic weather. They have skills that are used to influence risky decisions that need understanding of financial accounting data.  \r\n\r\n### Here are 10 things to do when you are hiring an accountant:\r\n\r\n**Get referrals:** Word of mouth is a great way to recruit a new accountant. When someone offers you a referral it is usually because they trust the person. It works both ways, the accountant too feels like they have to do their job well when they have been referred by a previous client. \r\n\r\n**Determine your business needs:** Knowing exactly what you expect is essential before hiring an accountant. Do you want someone who will advice you on many financial aspects of your business, small business accounting needs or just someone who will file your tax returns? When you have clear expectations and communicate them clearly to the accountant both of you will benefit. It is also important to check if your accountant has the credentials to sign financial statements and work on statutory compliance if you plan to have them do that as well.\r\n\r\n**Get licensed candidates:** There are three categories of professional accountants, with differences in their educational qualifications and duties. CAs, CMAs and the CGAs. Chartered accountants (CA) are recognized and trusted world over and offer various services including startup counseling right up to insolvency counseling.  Certified management accountants (CMA) integrate accounting expertise with advanced management skills, and certified general accountants (CGA) have a range of duties, from providing insights into financial statements and reports to overseeing internal accounting processes.\r\n\r\n**Determine accessibility:** Finding out how accessible your accountant is before hiring him is very important, do you need someone who has a whole team which can be available to you all day? Or is a single person all you need. Knowing your requirement will make the whole process of choosing an accountant much easier for both you and them. \r\n\r\n**How much are you going to be paying them?**  Most accountants charge on an hourly basis, the price differs from one firm to the other and also depends on the type of services they provide you. Know exactly what to expect in terms of charges so that you don’t end up getting a rude shock later. Don’t hesitate to ask for their hourly rate and bring along a copy of your tax returns to the interview so they know what type of work they are looking at.\r\n \r\n**Has the accountant done any work in your industry before?** This is especially good to know as accountants who have worked in your particular niche will have knowledge about business laws and regulations. Asking for names of their other clients is a great way to know more about this. \r\n\r\n**Is the accountant a business owner or been one?** If the accountant has been a business owner it could mean they could give you real time advice rather than something they learnt in school. \r\n\r\n**Are they tech savvy?** Much of accounting is on computers these days. While most accountants do keep up with industry standards it can be a good idea to find out more. Finding out whether the accountants firms has a website and is on social media can be a good way to gauge their views about technology. \r\n\r\n**How much risk can they tolerate?** Don’t hire someone who appears to be overly aggressive, it may seem like a good thing at first but remember that it could put your business at risk. Find someone who can be creative while working within the rules.\r\n\r\n**Make sure they stay in touch with you:** Look for someone who is enthusiastic and will inform you when they come across ideas that could benefit your business.\r\n\r\nWeather you''re looking for small business bookkeeping services, completing a tax return or full small business accounting Toronto service, Toronto has a wealth of professionals looking to provide you these services, the key is knowing how to look.', 0, 10, 8, 0, 1, NULL, 'The role of an accountant has evolved over the years, a couple of decades ago they would only be seen during tax season and disappear after that.

To retain and engage great employees you must build a strong workplace culture that is based in productivity and innovation. \r\n\r\n**Here are three things that every small business should know:**\r\n\r\n### Put the right policies and procedures in place \r\nKeep it simple, but keep it strong. Apply tried and tested principles and be prepared to work on retaining your top performers for the long term.  Human resources are the most important part of any business and hence do not under estimate HR. \r\n\r\nMany businesses struggle with employment law implementation and compliance. It can be a great idea to have a comprehensive workplace policy that covers everything you may encounter. Consulting an HR lawyer to draft a manual may seem like an unwanted expense but can go a long way to help your business. Make sure you are keeping your business’ culture and type in mind. \r\n\r\nSkilled talent is a lot more accessible now, you should focus on retaining your good employees by building strong workplace polices and ensure that these are governed by skilled HR staff.  \r\n\r\n### Hire a person not just the skill \r\nIt can be easy to hire an employee who has the skills your operation needs, but they may not be a cultural fit or be suited for the job as their real passion lays elsewhere. This could lead to higher staff turnover which is detrimental for the company in the long run. Hire only people who are bound to be a good fit and will likely stay for the long term. While interviewing focus on not just the skills but also the person, it can be easy to over-ride your gut instinct about a person if their credentials look good. \r\n\r\n**See also: [Top 10 Mistakes Startups Can Avoid Making](/article/10-mistakes-startups-make)**\r\n\r\n### Invest in leadership \r\nApart from being an effective leader yourself, you should also recruit and train leaders who can help the company grow. Leaders should be able to bring out the best in their team; they need to do so without being condescending or a pushover. Good leaders can be the reason your employees stay or decide to leave the company. They can be the difference between success and failures of new projects. Encourage them to listen to their team and communicate often and effectively. Assign mentors and role models for new employees to help them settle down better in the organization.  Having someone figure out the ropes of a new job could help retain employees. \r\n\r\nAs long as you remember that employees are the most valuable asset any company can have, you are on the right track to having a great company.', 0, 18, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'To grow your business successfully it is essential to be a great leader and have effective human resource management in place.', 'Staff', '', '2016-08-11 03:43:00', '2016-09-30 04:30:37'),

There has been a 15 percent spike in the number of foreign visitors into Canada from January to April this year, she said. \r\n\r\nThe demand began to increase at the end of last year and has since increased tremendously.

Slava is also a co-owner of AdWave, a marketing company specializing web design and in inbound marketing channels such as SEO, social media and online advertising.\r\n\r\n## What are the benefits of aerial photography for businesses?\r\nAs a aerial photography company, Sky Snap can provide customers with drones and UAV pilots for a number of applications that drones bring unique benefits in terms of cost, safety and time saved, when compared to traditional methods. \r\n\r\nHere are some examples of applications where Sky Snap''s services can make a difference:  \r\n\r\n### TV and Filmmakers\r\nWatch any kind of live TV show these days and you''ll probably catch a few shots where the camera seems to fly back and away from the host revealing a larger scene, and you''re pretty much guaranteed that''s a shot done with a drone - the cost and safety issues alone mean that things which would have been limited to helicopter photography are gone thanks to lightweight drones outfitted with high definition cameras. \r\n\r\n### Real Estate\r\nThe real estate market was one of the first businesses, along with the film and TV, to recognize the potential for drones. Almost overnight, drones made aerial photography available at a cost and quality unheard of ten years ago. For prospective buyers, an aerial view of a property is the best way to show the true dimensions of a location. Companies such as Sky Snap provide this as a service too if you don''t have a trained operator available or wish to purchase a drone of your own.\r\n\r\n### Resorts\r\nLike the real estate business, Resorts can use drone photography and video to give potential visitors an appreciation of your venue, after all one of the first thing which a visitor check out on a resort site is its pictures. Photos can provide a more engaging view of a resorts layout, gold courses, beaches and other highlights of the venue. \r\n\r\nOther industries are finding out drones can be used for more than just taking spectacular aerial shots.\r\n\r\n### Aerial Surveying is finding a growing market in inspecting wind turbines\r\nTraditionally the wind-energy industry has relied on doing manual turbine inspections with service people climbing up the towers; at 65 metres or more (about a 20 story apartment) for a large one, it''s potentially a dangerous situation, and one that has to be done regularly, maybe on dozens of wind turbine on a wind farm. It then often takes several hours for staff technicians to individually climb and inspect each turbine tower. \r\n\r\nAnother method sometimes used is to photograph the wind turbine from the ground at every angle possible, but this has a lot of obvious disadvantages. \r\n\r\nDrones can be operated from the ground and provide high-definition video footage or photographs of the turbine under inspection, including getting valuable footage of any damage done to the turbine''s blade tips - some of the most difficult and dangerous parts of the turbine to inspect manually. Using a drone, the remote-control operator and surveyors on the ground can capture every viewing angle within only 30 minutes Once a problem is identified, only then do technicians need to climb a turbine tower, reducing time (and money) spent on needless climbs and employee safety.\r\n\r\nAs a [Canadian Aerial Mapping Service](http://www.skysnap.ca/aerial-mapping-toronto) company, Sky Snap can handle jobs such as this or provide training to operators. \r\n\r\n### Construction Applications\r\nLike aerial surveying and mapping, drones have unique abilities to provide aerial photography of building under construction. Whether it''s providing inspections of areas that are hard, and/or potentially dangerous to access, or to provide an overview of progress to stakeholders, a drone, such as the types Sky Snap provides make a perfect tool. \r\nSky Snap offers [Aerial Surveying Services in Canada](http://www.skysnap.ca/aerial-surveying-toronto) that is perfect for this application.\r\n\r\n### Marketing and Branding\r\nLike film and real estate, the same kind of drones can also give a company''s branding and marketing a unique look; the aerial vantage location provides a look usually unseen, and that draws attention. Aerial photography can enhance a business'' visual appeal.\r\n\r\nOn their company blog, Sky Snap offers useful information on these and other services, check it regularly for updates.\r\n\r\nLocation:<br>\r\nSky Snap''s main office is in Concord, Ontario, just north of Toronto.<br>\r\n231 Millway Ave #1, Concord, ON L4K 3W7<br>\r\nPhone: 877-503-8837<br>', 0, 18, NULL, 0, 1, 49, 'Sky Snap is a Canadian company that offers drone rentals and drone photography services including:  aerial surveying services and aerial mapping services.', 'Staff', '', '2016-08-21 00:30:27', '2016-08-30 02:12:45'),

But now we have independent companies right here in Canada who make these unique grooming products. \r\n\r\n“There is definitely a strong demand on the vendor side to create these products and then on the consumer side to seek them out and support them as well.” Nicholas Burton-Vulovic, marketing manager for the online retailer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fendrihan/pages/13658027011?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=yyzca-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=5ae8f756bd1680c101ca0a56489e5753&camp=1789&creative=9325">Fendrihan</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=yyzca-20&l=ur2&o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, based in Ancaster, Ontario recently said. The website specializes in men’s shaving products from around the world and now showcases many Canadian creams, soaps, oil and lotions.\r\n\r\nHandcrafted products and beard maintenance items became much more readily available thanks to the new crop of Canadian entrepreneurs in this sector. \r\n\r\n**See also: [Low Dollar Hits Midsized Fashion Retailers](/article/low-loonie-hits-midsized-fashion-retailers)**\r\n\r\n“We saw a void in the marketplace, there was nothing of quality or cutting edge and current in the marketplace in Canada,” said Jason Ritchie, co-founder of [Prairie Boys Supply Co.](http://www.prairieboyssupplyco.com/)  His company offers hair-styling products and other products including beard and shave oils, beard balms, razors, combs and even clothing.\r\n\r\nPrairie Boys Supply Co has around $40,000 in sales from direct sales on their online store, through retail outlets and more through a distribution agreement. Around 70 percent of these sales are domestic, 20 percent are from American customers and the rest are from customers in countries like Japan and Australia.\r\n\r\nAnother popular company in the same niche is [Midnight&Two](http://www.midnightandtwo.com/) which focuses on shaving products like like pre-shave oil and after-shave balm. Their first wholesale customer was a speciality shave shop Kent of Inglewood, which has branches in Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa. Midnight&Two too grew because demand just kept increasing from the retailers as customers were ready to buy these new products. \r\n\r\nExperts in this niche say that many grooming products now available are consumer goods like soaps and balms rather than hardware goods like razors. This made it easier for many entrepreneurs to enter this niche. \r\n\r\nWhile some may think that these types of new grooming products are directed towards the youth of today only, the truth is far from that. They are not just on trend items that are just a fad but rather personal grooming products that men will use for a long time once they start. While the most popular demographic to sell the products to is the 25 to 35 year olds, there are other customers too who are baby boomers or retirees. \r\n\r\nThese items could also be the new gift idea for men as many women look to buy these specialty products as gifts for the difficult-to-buy-for men in their life. If more people start thinking of these as a gift for a dad, brother, boyfriend then the industry is set to boom.\r\n\r\n<a style="text-align: center;margin: 1em auto;display: block;" href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/s679uoxuowBKDFDDDEBDEHHKJKKBDGIFHEDGKLCCC" target="_blank" onmouseover="window.status=''http://www.aliexpress.com/'';return true;" onmouseout="window.status='' '';return true;">\r\n<img src="http://www.tqlkg.com/q879fz2rxvGPIKIIIJGIJMMPOPPGILNKMJILPQHHH" alt="" border="0"/></a>', 0, 5, 6, 0, 1, NULL, 'A couple of years ago the only ‘grooming’ products available for men was razors, shaving foam and a musky cologne.

The regulations and laws that apply to commercial drone use are heavily enforced, and compliance is required to operate the drone with commercial intent.  \r\n  \r\nWhen operating a drone, it''s required to adhere to specific guidelines and rules for the health and safety of the operating team, also of the surrounding people, and of any manned aircraft located in the near vicinity. Here are a few tips from a [Toronto Aerial Real Estate Photography Company](http://www.skysnap.ca/aerial-real-estate-photography-toronto)\r\n\r\n## Required Operating Guidelines\r\n\r\n- **Daylight and good weather.**  \r\n     All drone flights are required to be taken in both daylight and relatively good weather.\r\n- **Must remain within sight constantly.**  \r\n     Unmanned Aerial Vehicles must constantly remain within sight.\r\n- **Stay away from populated areas.**  \r\n     All drones are to stay a safe distance away from airport space, from populated areas and any busy roads (30 metres from buildings, people, aircraft, and roads), and they must not go vertically higher than 90 metres.\r\n- **Respect the privacy of others.**  \r\n     It''s strictly prohibited by law for drones to be used for the intent of spying on anyone without their consent and cooperation.\r\n\r\nWhile the majority of these regulations are oriented towards safety, they are also capable of affecting how someone is allowed to capture any aerial imagery, and could possibly be prohibitive of specific properties.\r\n\r\n## Finding a Drone-Friendly Property\r\n\r\nWhen on the lookout for properties that you can photograph with a drone, there are a few requirements. First of all, there needs to be an adequate amount of clear space for the drone to be operated safely. Second, densely populated regions and urban areas, such as those near main roads, or close to crowded public areas such as parks and schools should not have drones operating within them unless you can maintain a 30-metre perimeter. Drones are also not permitted in controlled airspace.  \r\n\r\n**See also: [Sky Snap, a Toronto-based Drone Services Company](/article/skysnap-toronto-drone-services-company)**\r\n  \r\nDrones are not difficult to attain. It''s quite easy to get your hands on one, but acquiring the legal documentation required to operate it commercially isn''t. It''s a challenging and time-consuming process that can take up to a month. Most commercial operations regarding drones require a least an SFOC, also known as a Single-Operation Special Flight Operation Certificate. This is a document which requires the operator to provide confirmation of sufficient liability insurance, a good knowledge of meteorology, airspace regulations, and at times, even pilot training.  \r\n  \r\nA realtor should never consider hiring a drone operator unless they have the required documentation. SkySnap, a specialized [drone photography Toronto company](http://www.skysnap.ca/) stresses the importance of the necessary permits and operational safety planning. The SFOC is necessary to legally operate a drone with commercial intent. Emergency management, risk mitigation, and insurance coverage all have the same amount of implications for the realtor as they do for the operator.\r\n\r\n## Things to Consider Before Using a Drone\r\n\r\n- Is the property safe for drone operation?\r\n- Is it in or near a densely populated area?\r\n- Is it next to a busy area or main road?\r\n- Is the weather ideal for safe drone flight?', 0, 20, 16, 0, 1, NULL, 'Drones are one of the best ways to capture truly appealing images from a variety of unique perspectives.

This is an art that you can master with experience.\r\n\r\n## Here are our top ten ways to make meeting new people easier:\r\n\r\n1. Start off with a ‘hello’ and introduce yourself. A good handshake can go a long way in creating a favourable impression.\r\n\r\n2. You could start out a conversation by asking if the other person is originally from the place where the event is held or they travelled to be here.\r\n\r\n3. Asking a person what kind of volunteer work they engage in is a great conversation starter especially in charity related events\r\n\r\n4. Food is something that everyone has an opinion about, starting a conversation about the food served is a great way to get someone to talk to you.\r\n\r\n5. Instead of just asking for someone’s name, you could ask them what motivated them to attend the event. This question could give you insight on their personality and career goals.\r\n\r\n6. Complimenting a person on their shoes or something else they are wearing could be a good conversation starter. However only do this if you really want to compliment them, or they could end up thinking you are a phony. It is also important to ensure the compliment in not inappropriate based on the gender of the person you are talking to.\r\n\r\n7. Most people love to be asked for advice. While asking for insight or advice from a person you just met can be tricky, you can use this to your advantage by asking for insight on something the person is likely to familiar in or something you noticed they own.\r\n\r\n8. Asking questions about something going on around you is the best way to get the other person to talk. If you are at an event, you could ask what the person thought about the speaker or a previous speaker or whether they were regulars at the event. \r\n\r\n9. You could ask if they heard about the big news that happened recently, or a recent event that made headlines. However you should make sure that the topic you choose to bring to the conversation is not a very controversial one.\r\n\r\n10. Talking about sports or activities the person indulges in when they are not working could help make the person relaxed and talk more.\r\n\r\nTry these out at the next business event you attend and write to us to let us know which one worked out for you.

This could enhance our innovation and commercialization capacity, experts said. \r\n\r\nThis strategic approach has been successfully used in the past to support companies. International rules restricted the ability of governments to give preferential treatment to goods and services produced by domestic firms. This strategy was used there to support these companies through pre-commercial procurement. A similar method can also be used in intellectual property rights.\r\n\r\nOther countries have already used this strategy; they have used state-backed patent funds to protect their national firms. Countries like Japan, South Korea and France are successfully using these funds to acquire patents, license them and even enforce them if the need arises. \r\n\r\nThis patent fund model can help commercialize Canada’s intellectual property while abiding with the rules of international trade.

The company is poised for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) that could well change its future. The company took the shoe market by storm by changing the way people were buying shoes. Its founder Roger Hardy sold off his successful eye-care web business ClearlyContacts to combine two online shoe sellers into this larger business. Shoes.com has also diversified its business by acquiring socks and underwear company Richer Poorer. This company definitely gets a prime position on our Canadian companies to watch list. \r\n\r\n### Hootsuite\r\nHootsuite, with its owl logo, is the most widely used platform for managing social media. The company is in the news for all the right reasons and could be one of the most important stories to come this year. As social media becomes stronger than ever, Hootsuite too is set to grow. While this company did face some reorganization and even endured some layoffs last year, we should remember that it is one of Canada’s fastest growing startups in history that we are talking about. This is one of the most important companies to watch out for. \r\n\r\n### Zootly\r\nZootly has been defined as the ‘Uber’ of moving companies. The startup is making waves in the moving industry with its app. Zootly works as a logistics operator connecting moving companies and people who are looking to move in New York and is expected to be available in other cities in the U.S and Canada soon. The company is looking to launch its IPO soon. While it has often been compared to Uber, it will not face the hiccups that Uber did since Zootly doesn’t bypass traditional moving companies.  \r\n\r\n### Bridgit\r\nThis is a subscription based app designed for construction workers to make life easier for them. The app connects contractors and laborers and keeps them updated on their project and also has integrated messaging and images.  This could be the latest in the building and construction industry and hence is on our watch list. \r\n\r\n### Slack\r\nIf you weren’t sure whether to cut this one some slack then it is time. Slack is a messaging app that its users say is different from the number of other messaging services that can be downloaded for free. The app which is said to have around 2 million active users is also known to be very user friendly and addictive. The company is looking to build platforms and bots to integrate into its main app making it a absolutely essential to keep on our list. \r\n\r\n### Figure 1\r\nFigure 1 is another medical tech company that is making waves. It is a way for doctors to share and discuss about compelling medical cases. Known among the medical community as the ‘Instagram for doctors’ it has been gaining popularity with doctors worldwide. As top medical professionals continue using Figure 1, it is definitely the right fit here on our must-watch companies list.  \r\n\r\n### Vision Critical\r\nVancouver based Vision Critical is a platform that helps companies build communities of customers for feedback. We are keeping our eyes on this company as it is expecting its Initial Public Offering (IPO) very soon.  The company said it was ‘very close’ to being ready for IPO and just like anyone else we would love a slice of the Vision Critical pie. This company is probably going to stay on the must-watch companies list even after the IPO. \r\n\r\n### Wiivv\r\n3D printing has often been seen as the ‘future’, this company takes 3D printing technology and computer vision technology to build gear that uses data from smartphones. They are custom printed wearables. The company has seen some seed funding and venture funding so definitely takes a sought-after place on our list. \r\n\r\n### Nudge\r\nThis is an app that nudges you in the direction of making better professional relationships. Nudge claims to leverage your professional network and could very well be the future for some of us looking to build business relationships that last. We will be keeping an eye out for the ‘nudge’. \r\n\r\n### Showbie\r\nAlberta based Showbie has nothing to do with showbiz, it is an application that targets at paperless classrooms and aims at bringing better technology to students to teachers. The app has around 2 million teachers and students using it and is now available to parents aiming to make education more transparent and easier to track. This one seems to have all the makings of a winner so we recommend you keep a watch on Showbie. \r\n\r\n### Atomwise\r\nAtomwise is a company that focuses on developing artificial intelligence for drug discovery. While developing new medicines take 15 years on average with high costs to boot, this company is using technology to bring about change in the sector. This is a lifesaving endeavor that can speed up the process of medical solutions. Atomwise moved to Y Combinator in Silicon Valley from the University of Toronto incubator, however that does not stop it from being on our watch list. \r\n\r\n### BlackBerry \r\nBlackBerry has, in the past, been Canada’s pride and has been the largest tech company. While the company did face a fall it shouldn’t be written off just yet and thus it earns a spot on our list.

However it is important to know that the venture capital investor you have on board with you is a right fit for your startup. ', 'Investors don’t really folk over their money easily, they conduct due diligence on the companies they are interested in and only then make a deal. You should know that your investor will look into your company and your professional portfolio as an entrepreneur. Similarly you too should be ready to conduct some due diligence on your potential investor. \r\n\r\nRemember that where your investment comes from can also be a major factor in how far your company can go, not all investors are the same. The personality of the investor and the business method they choose to use could prove to be either great or absolutely terrible for your startup. The investor may be great in their arena but are they good for yours? Some background research and quick knowledge of the investor could go a long way in creating business relationships that last. \r\n\r\nVenture capitalists usually specialize in building high risk financial portfolios. With venture capital, the venture capital firm gives funding to the startup company in exchange for equity in the startup.\r\n\r\nHere are some things you should consider before you begin work with a venture capitalist or receive funds from a venture capital fund. These 7 things are very important – personality of the venture capital funding investor, domain knowledge and prior experience, active or dormant investing, track record, strategy, stage, and tenure. \r\n\r\n### Personality of the investor \r\nJust like with everything else, here too the personality of the person you are going to be working with is very important. Choosing an investor is pretty much like choosing a co founder for your startup. Remember that this is not a short term relationship, both of you will be working together for the company for as long as you can, until the company closes or one of you decides to leave. Choose someone whose personality is the right fit for you making the decision more about interpersonal relationships rather than venture capital finance cash. Ask yourself if this is the person you want to be around when the going gets tough. \r\n\r\n### Domain knowledge and prior experience \r\nOnce you have established that the personality of the investor is just right for you, another important thing to look for in an investor is their domain knowledge about your industry and any previous experience they have in this field. While they could have been a successful investor in a completely different sector can they bring value to your company if they have no expertise in this particular domain?\r\n\r\n### Active or dormant? \r\nIs the investor actively involved in venture capital finance investing at all? There are many people who claim to be actively investing and meet entrepreneurs scouting for the perfect deal, knowing whether your investor has made an investment in the past year can help you know whether you are just wasting your time. \r\n\r\n### Track record\r\nKnowing about the financial track record of your investor can help you ascertain what to expect from them. Choose people who have a good reputation and are well connected, stay away from investors whose bad reputation precedes them as your credibility is at stake here. \r\n\r\n### Strategy\r\nWhat is the strategy of your new investor? A strategic investor should be able to bring in value apart from the monetary investment.  Does the investor have connections in your industry? Will they bring with them any strategic advantages that will make your business more relevant? \r\n\r\n### Stage\r\nThe stage of your company and the investment fund are both important aspects to consider when selecting an investor. If you are looking for early stage funding then you shouldn’t be wasting your time talking to investors who only invest in later stage rounds. \r\n\r\nWhen choosing a fund remember that it is better to receive venture financing from a venture fund that is still early in its lifecycle. The early stages of a Venture fund are when venture capitalists invest actively and when the fund is reaching the end of its lifecycle the investors seek cash returns from their investments. \r\n\r\nWhen a fund is closer to the end of its lifecycle you should be prepared to provide a liquidity event, getting an investment from a new fund which is early in its lifecycle will reduce the pressure on you to accept a premature liquidity. Another advantage is that the fund will have more resources to invest in your company. \r\n\r\n### Tenure \r\nHow long an investor has been with their current fund can make a difference to the investment they bring. However it is not essential to only look for a well seasoned venture capitalist with a lot of connections, remember you are a startup so it could be more practical to work for an investor who is still early in their career but respected. Here it is important to note that the personality of the investor and their compatibility with your company is more important than the age or tenure of the investor.', 0, 10, 18, 0, 1, NULL, 'When you are a startup looking for an investment, any investment can seem like a great thing.

Many mistakes are usually made in the first year; these mistakes could cost you big, not just financially but also with your reputation. After speaking to several successful businesspeople we have created for you a list of 10 mistakes that every startup should avoid making. \r\n\r\n**If you don’t want success to evade you should avoid making these mistakes:**\r\n\r\n## Building a product no one wants to use \r\nYou could easily defend yourself saying once your product is out you will have buyers, but this is seriously number one on our list. For your product or service to be a best seller it is essential that people be willing use it. \r\n\r\n## Hiring poorly \r\nHiring the cheapest guy you find may seem like the best way to go about when you a startup but remember that your first employees are what make your company. Utilise your time and skills to find the best fit for your company. \r\n\r\n**See also: [Three Human Resource Tips for Every Small Business](/article/three-human-resource-tips-for-every-small-business)**\r\n\r\n## Lack of focus\r\nClassic startup 101 tip: Focus is everything. While your vision for the company is very important you should remember to be focused and not lose control. \r\n\r\n## Fail to execute sales and marketing \r\nThe best way to deal with this is to have realistic goals. If you feel you cannot meet your own expectations then find out how you can even if it means hiring an expensive sales person. \r\n\r\n## Not having the right co-founder \r\nThis could be the biggest mistake you make. Choosing a co-founder is like getting married, it is a relationship that will last until your company exists. \r\n\r\n## Chasing investors, not customers \r\nFinding an investor can seem like the biggest thing on your agenda, but remember it is the customers who are going to become the market for your company not your investor. \r\n\r\n## Not making sure you have enough funds \r\nHow are you funding your startup, is your investor being too stingy? Making sure you have enough funds to be in business can go a long way to make your startup last.\r\n\r\n## Spending too much money\r\nThis is again something that many startups are guilty of doing. Keep track of your expenses and financial priorities. Make this a habit right from your first days as a company to help your company grow.\r\n\r\n**See also: [Tax Season and Crowdfunding](/article/tax-season-reads-the-economics-of-a-crowdfunding-campaign)**\r\n\r\n## Failing to ask for help\r\nAsking for help is not an easy; however you must understand that building a successful business is not an easy thing either. Asking experienced people for help or finding a mentor who will help you can go a long way in preventing mistakes.\r\n\r\n## Ignoring social media\r\nIt is very important to use social media to your advantage. Not only startups even the most established companies use social media to further their cause.

Cutting out the middle man, the service garage and its staff, helps the customer save a good amount of money. \r\n\r\nTransparency between mechanics and car owners is also something the app is hoping to increase. The website features repair details and a cost calculator so customers won’t have to worry about a mysterious repair that comes up after the mechanic has inspected the car. \r\n\r\nCustomers can request a general inspection service, where a mechanic will inspect the car to determine if it needs any repairs or servicing. If the car owners get the repairs made by the Fiix mechanic, then the inspection is at no cost.  \r\n\r\nThe platform now has 8 mechanics and will eventually expand nationally.

This is especially true when buying property since they give importance to feng shui, which governs spatial arrangement and orientation in relation to the flow of energy in buildings.\r\n\r\nAsian buyers will usually check the basic feng shui of a house themselves or may get it checked by an expert. Your personal views about the concept are immaterial as you should be sensitive about the buyer’s preferences. Buyers pay attention to the direction the main door of the house faces and the positioning of the staircase, the address number is also an important factor in their property selection as some numbers are considered luckier than others. Hiring a feng shui expert to certify the house could mean more bids on the house. \r\n\r\nEven a simple act of handing over your business card to an Asian buyer can be significant. Use both your hands to hand over the card and similarly receive a card handed to your with both your hands.

Here are some of the most common ones.', 'Scams and fraud investments exists just about everywhere these days, from the emails which claim to be from a long lost relative of a prince to the more larger scale wall street investment scams. In the world of real estate there are scams that every buyer needs to be aware about. Protecting yourself from these scams can actually require more vigilance that you would think. \r\nHere are 5 real estate scams and how to spot them. \r\n\r\n### Title Company Fraud	\r\nThis is possibly the fraud with the worst consequences. The fraud starts with identity theft, the scammer poses as the real property owner and using forged documents transfers the property to his own name and even gets a mortgage on the house. After he secures a mortgage the scammer flees with the cash leaving the real owner pay for future payments. These types of scammers tend to prefer homes that don’t have existing mortgages and people who are less likely to know about identity theft. Home owners who rent out their homes or have no mortgage on it are more likely to become targets of this fraud. The best way to be protected from this scam is to take insurance that provides coverage against title fraud though title insurance.\r\n\r\nSpotting this fraud can be difficult but protection of personal data is very important in preventing such scams. Home owners should take extra precaution while protecting their documents and identity related paperwork and possibly look into title insurance.\r\n\r\nRemember that identity theft is not something that can only be committed by strangers. There have been instances where spouses have mortgaged property without telling their spouse. It could also be a lawyer or notary who is committing the crime of absconding with the funds. \r\n\r\n### Foreclosure and home-equity fraud\r\nThis type of real estate fraud usually takes advantage of a property owner who is short on mortgage, there are two common ways scammers exploit a home owner’s need for cash. In a foreclosure fraud, the owner of the property is approached by a scammer who offers a loan to cover the mortgage; this is the real-estate version of the email-scam. Scammer claim to charge an initial fee for processing the loan and later make the owners sign an agreement to transfer the property title. The scammer then remortgages the house and makes away with the money, the property owner is still left with his original mortgage but now he has no house. This is one of the most popular types of mortgage fraud.\r\n\r\n### Online property rental and sales scams \r\nWhere most online property advertisements are real, there are scammers there too. They advertise property at low rates in online sites such as Craigslist and then demand the payment for the rental either online or at another place. The scam is that the property does not belong to them in reality; they are simply impersonating the owner and claiming to rent out the house. When the renters arrive at the property they realise they were being duped all along.  The best to spot a scam is to remember that if something looks too good to be true it probably is. Another tip is to rely on the more sought after real estate rental websites. \r\n\r\n### Property investment seminars and courses\r\nAttending seminars and courses on property investment can be a great way to learn more, but here too you could get scammed. While these are not as bad as the other scams we have talked about, these scams could make you spend substantial amounts of money without providing quality return on your investment. \r\n\r\nWhile there are many good real estate experts who could have good quality seminars it is better to err on the side of caution while picking a seminar to attend especially if you are paying a steep charge. Try to stay away from seminars that suggest you make high risk investments. \r\n\r\n**[How to Spot 7 Common Investment Scams](/article/7-investment-scams-to-stay-away-from)**\r\n\r\n### Home Improvement scams\r\nThese are lower-end scams but bad nonetheless. These scammers claim they can work for cheap rates because they have material leftover from a previous job. An easy way to spot a home improvement scams is the high pressure sales tactics they use. \r\n\r\nThe best way to stay away from being scammed is to not pay in cash for home repairs upfront and to always hire someone who has a recommendation from a friend or neighbour.', 0, 16, NULL, 0, 1, NULL, 'From tittle fraud to fake investment seminars and home Improvement scams there are a number of things to watch out for.

', 'Since Hydro-Québec was nationalized in the 1960s, Quebec has had a good reputation in the international hydroelectric engineering sector. The largest hydroelectric systems in the world, the James Bay Project, further helped get the expertise noticed. \r\n\r\nNow, a team of Canadian engineers are building hydroelectric dams in Albania in what is seen as a controversial move as the dam, built across the Balkans, is said to have bad environmental standards with critics claiming it could destroy the rivers in the project. \r\n\r\nCritics have also called the project a ‘dam tsunami’, referring to seismic waves which could cause huge harm and also claim the project is covered in corruption.\r\n\r\nMontreal based company Hydro Investment recently completed a dam in Albania, it said its project is environmentally strong and showcases Canada’s expertise in hydroelectric installations.\r\n\r\nSoutheastern Europe uses less than half of its hydropower potential according to experts. Albania is no exception, the country which is now open to foreign investment thanks to free-market reforms in infrastructure needs the electricity generated by the hydroelectric installations. \r\n\r\nAlbania’s aging hydroelectric power plants generate a huge part of the energy the country needs while it has to import about a third of energy it uses. \r\nThere are about 611 future projects in the Balkan region that is expected to add a total capacity of about 18 gigawatts, Christiane Zarfl, a professor at the Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries in Berlin recently said. \r\n\r\nOf these around four dams of at least one megawatt are already under construction, this, without including smaller projects which are being planned or already under construction. \r\n\r\nHydropower is the preferred choice for the Balkan region not only as it is a flexible and renewable energy source but since the potential of rivers still remains high. There are several rivers that could be used to build more dams, Zarfl added. \r\n\r\nSources have that the government of Albania has given concession for at least 435 hydropower projects. While Hydropower is seen as a safe renewable source, critics and environmental activists claim the harmful effects and environmental impact is important to look into. Diverting rivers can block species migrations and disrupt ecosystems, they said.  \r\n\r\nThe destruction of a pristine habitat could lead to many issues the ecosystem would not suffer but even other ecosystem services such as drinking water supply to humans could be affected. \r\n\r\nDams are destroying the few remaining pristine rivers in Europe and the unique ecosystem that surround it. Given the huge number of dams planned, some species could go extinct, the critics point out. \r\n\r\nHowever it remains important to note that none of these companies are flouting rules. Even the critics understand that the companies cannot be lawfully approached and the only course of action they have towards protecting the eco system is a moral obligation. \r\n\r\nWhile Albania’s need for reliable electricity is understandable it should use a more diversified method to deal to bring the best of power generating techniques to the forefront including using more solar and wind energy in addition to building dams to use hydro power.', 0, 15, 0, 0, 1, NULL, 'Now, a team of Canadian engineers are building hydroelectric dams in Albania in what is seen as a controversial move as the dam, built across the Balkans, is said to have bad environmental standards with critics claiming it could destroy the rivers in the project.', 'Staff', '', '2016-09-29 01:42:59', '2016-09-29 01:42:59'),

', 'Holborn Group CEO and Developer Joo Kim Tiahsaid the tax has affected offshore presale buyers who have now decided they don’t want to close the deal in the wake of the 15 percent tax levy. The group said it has sold all the luxuary condos in the tower at an average $1,615 per square foot, which sets a new record for a condo in Canada.\r\n\r\nLuxuary penthouses in the tower are expected to priced starting are $20 million when they are available next year. \r\n\r\nThe developers have admitted that a small percentage of buyers are now saying they can’t close the deal and that they are helping them get financing to help finalize the sale. \r\n\r\nAnother trend some foreign buyers are practicing is to assign their properties to a Canadian relative, this is becoming an industry practice to close the deals at the price initially agreed upon, some experts say. Assigning to relatives is a common phenomenon in presales; however it can only be assigned at the agreed-upon price so buyers don’t flip the property. \r\n\r\nAbout 10 percent of the units at Trump Tower were purchased by buyers who had foreign passports, Developer Joo Kim Tiahsaid said. \r\n\r\nThe new tax applies to purchases that were in process, this was something experts seem to agree was uncalled for as the stability of deals made was hurt by it. Buyers who entered into contracts a couple of years ago now have to pay 15 percent more.  \r\n\r\nThe property transfer gets paid when a buyer registers ownership with the land titles office, since presales are made years in advance it doesn’t get paid until residents take occupancy.  This is especially bad for developers whose buildings are nearing completion as presale buyers could rather lose their deposit than raise an additional 15 percent to close the deal. \r\n\r\n**See also: [Chinese Nationals Make up Most of 5% of Vancouver Homes Sold to Non-Canadians](/article/5-percent-of-all-vancouver-homes-sold-are-bought-by-foreigners)**\r\n\r\nThis new tax has also changed developers minds on assignments, developers who were not fully happy about assignments earlier now realise it is their interest.  \r\n\r\nAssignments don’t really work unless it is with a trusted relative or close friend; the buyer is literally selling their rights to the property. It may be transferred back later but since all transactions are covered by the revenue agency it can be difficult to make large payments to your relative without dealing with issues. \r\n\r\nSome experts feel that the time is right for Canadian buyers to close deals as some foreign buyers are not eager to buy.  While volume of real estate sales is expected to decrease in the next few months, most experts agree that the tax is not going to have a lasting impact on the real estate economy.\r\nThe 15 percent foreign buyer tax is not the first issue the tower is facing it has previously been in the news for new ownership and lawsuits by investors.', 0, 16, 8, 0, 1, NULL, 'The Trump International Hotel and Tower in Vancouver set a record price when it was sold out, however it now looks like the 15 percent foreign buyer tax being implemented is making presale buyers uncomfortable.', 'Staff', '', '2016-10-02 17:42:56', '2016-10-02 17:48:25'),

So how does one deal with it? \r\n\r\nImproving your time management is the best way to enjoy a productive day even when your spirit is not as high as it should be. Don’t aim to finish a ton of work, but aim to complete a couple of important tasks that are important and bring your closer to your goals. \r\n\r\nOn such days remind yourself that it is the quality of work that is important not the quantity, here are some ways to turn a bad day into a productive one\r\nIdentify the 3 most important tasks of the day. \r\n\r\nWhile this is relevant for any ordinary day at work, it is especially necessary when you know you are having an unproductive day. Getting the most important tasks finished first is the best way to get things done productively. It is easy to get distracted and lose focus and the best way to stay focused is to only focus on the most important tasks at hand. Choose the important asks based on the action they bring towards your goal. \r\n\r\n### Rank them\r\nOnce you have identified the tasks you intend to complete, make them the main focus of your day. Write down the tasks and tick them off when you finish them. Number them in order of urgency and importance, Number 1 should be the most important one and 3 the least important among the three. \r\n\r\n### Next set of three important tasks \r\nOnce you have identified the first set of three most important tasks, move on to identifying the next of three most important tasks of the day in the same manner. Try to work in sets of three and think of your tasks as sets. Like the reps at the gym, soon you will plan all your tasks in a similar way. \r\n\r\n### Schedule your tasks \r\nScheduling your three most important tasks ahead of time is a great way to ensure you get it done on time. You have already planned it there is nothing else to do but get it done right? \r\n\r\n### Tackle the most important task first \r\nGetting the most important task finished first is the best way to make your day already seem like a productive one. The impact from completing your most important task will help you in your other tasks as you already feel like you have accomplished something for the day. \r\n\r\n### Set a timer \r\nChoose a block of time you would like to work for, it could be 30 minutes to 45 minutes. When your alarm rings you should stop working, but not until it does. \r\n\r\nUsing this approach will help you stay clear of all distractions and you will be less tempted to quickly check your Facebook page. Try to put your phone a little away when you are working, turn the notifications off on text messages but have your ringer on for phone calls. \r\n\r\n**See also: [5 Ways to Stop Procrastination in Its Tracks](/article/top-15-ways-to-stop-procrastination-in-its-tracks)**\r\n\r\n### Take a break \r\nTaking a quick break before you start another task is the best way to go into it with a fresh mind.

Postponing tasks is an issue that most knowledge workers face, when your work is not laid out for you, it can be very easy to procrastinate. \r\n\r\nIn most workplaces these days, employees identify and design their own schedule this makes it much more efficient to work better, however on a bad day it could also mean you are procrastinating for no good reason at all. Procrastination is basically avoiding doing a task which you need to get done, and doing less urgent things instead.  \r\n\r\nWhile procrastination can be a deep rooted problem in our modern society, there are many way we can personally overcome it to make our lives easier and reach our goals faster.\r\n\r\n### Here are 15 tips to stop procrastination and make your life a lot better:\r\n\r\n1. **Denial isn’t just a river in Egypt.** Acknowledging your Procrastination is the first step to eliminating it. Don’t be embarrassed, you aren’t the only one doing it. In fact it is a widely known fact that only intelligent people procrastinate. But once you acknowledge it you can then move on to acting on it.\r\n\r\n2. **Once you have acknowledged your tendency to procrastinate it is now time to determine why you are doing it.** Getting to the source of the problem is the best way to analyse it. Are you bored? Are the tasks not challenging enough? Learning more about your reason for postponing could be very important.\r\n\r\n3. **Understand that you cannot do everything at once.** You must prioritize your tasks and work on the most important ones first. Remember that completing one really important task is much more effective than spending a lot on time on unimportant tasks. Focus on the quality of work rather than trying to get more tasks done in a short time. Ask yourself if you are getting the intended results from your work.  \r\n\r\n4. **Asking others for help is often the best way to get things done.** If you are overwhelmed with the amount of work you have to do, don’t hesitate to ask someone for help. Remember that you have to start somewhere; you just have to decide where. \r\n\r\n5. **Visualise the benefits you would gain from completing your task well.** Understanding the benefits of completing your task can be a good motivator to get you getting started on a project.\r\n\r\n6. **Revisit your goals often to understand where you have reached.** Not only will your goals inspire you but you are less likely to want to procrastinate when you are thinking about your goals and the course of action to get there.\r\n\r\n7. **Break down your work into smaller tasks to accomplish.** Work towards completing those tasks within the time you have allocated for them. Be realistic while allocating time. Cutting down tasks into smaller sets also makes it easier for you to track progress \r\n\r\n**See also: [How to Have a Productive Day When You Aren''t Feeling Great](/article/how-to-have-a-productive-day-when-you-arent-feeling-great)**\r\n\r\n8. **Eliminated all distractions around you.** You know better than anyone the things that make you unproductive, keep them away from your workplace and place your phone upside down. \r\n\r\n9. **When you want to enjoy the things that you get distracted from work for, schedule them.** Making sure you have time allocated to these distractions ensures that the time you spend working is not wasted but you have something to look forward to.\r\n\r\n10. **Understand that perfection is not a necessity.** Sometimes it can pay to be imperfect. \r\n\r\n11. **Choose a single task and stick to it till you finish.** While multitasking is often associated with being more productive it is not recommended to those who are more prone to procrastination than others.\r\n\r\n12. **Changing your work environment can also be a great way to stop procrastination.** If you are working in bed then it is probably time to move to a desk. \r\n\r\n13. **The two minute task challenge** – if a task only takes two minutes to complete, do it right away. \r\n\r\n14. **Use bad experiences and unpleasant consequences to motivate yourself.** Tell yourself you can’t go to the movies this week if you don’t finish this task. Challenge yourself by coming up with innovative motivators every single time. \r\n\r\n15. **Instill a sense of urgency in you.** Use the Pomodoro technique with which when you work for 25 minutes without interruption, you then take a 5 minute break and then focus for another 25 minutes.\r\n\r\nUsing these tips will help you make your day a lot more productive and hopefully you will be motivated to use these tips in the long run.

Starting with a 25,000 square foot facility as a structural steel fabricator serving the central Ohio area, Ohio Steel Industries has expanded over the years and today offers products and services in five areas: Structural Steel Fabrication, Plastic Extrusion, Contract Manufacturing, Lawn and Garden equipment, and trailers.\r\n\r\nOhio Steel manufactures a variety of high-quality lawn and garden carts available at retailers and power equipment dealers worldwide.

[GardenCart.ca](http://GardenCart.ca) sells a number of Ohio Steel''s Dump Carts.\r\n\r\n### Muller''s Smart Carts\r\nAs with all great products, the original Muller’s Smart Cart was created out of need for something better.In 1975, Brigadier General Henry Muller of Santa Barbara, California was presented with a problem: His wife who was in her 60’s, was unable to manage a wheelbarrow in their stable without it tilting and causing back pain. Because he knew how much his wife loved her stable work, Henry Muller created the first easy-to-use, lightweight, durable and well balanced stable cart on the market. He patented his new product the Muller’s Stablemate and began selling his design at nearby stables and ranches.\r\n\r\nThough the company’s name has changed throughout the years from Muller’s Town and Country Cart to Smart Cart to Carr Industries to Muller''s Smart Carts of Maine, to Muller’s Carts and finally to Smart Carts Enterprises LLC, the product’s original design remains practically unchanged. Brigadier General Muller’s original design has been shown time and again to withstand heavy use for decades with little to no need for maintenance or repair.Their carts are found at the White House, Walt Disney’s Landscaping Departments, many Zoos including the San Diego Zoo, at MGM Studios, The Hearst Castle, at Strybing Arboretum and beyond. Today, they are based out in Gorham, Maine (near Portland) making the same quality carts that began in 1975. They use local suppliers for parts beyond their capabilities.\r\n\r\nThese legendary carts are designed with ergonomics and ease of movement in mind. These carts are made from durable plastics and steel and come with A lifetime warranty on the frame and a 5-year warranty on the tub.\r\n\r\n[GardenCart.ca](http://GardenCart.ca) sells a number of Muller''s products, see the [website](http://GardenCart.ca) for details.\r\n\r\n### Gorilla Carts from Tricam Industries\r\nAt Gorilla Carts, their mission is to design and engineer products that exceed the highest expectations and their team prides itself on the products and the strong relationships with customers they have maintained from the start.

Hardly any effort is required to move the cart with a 330lb (150kg) load on it. Once folded the carts require less than 2 sf storage space. Due to its light weight and small footprint when folded this is a perfect boating cart. These carts are super easy to clean because they are all aluminium - just use a garden hose and do not worry about any rust: the high-grade marine aluminium construction is completely rust and corrosion resistant, even after years of exposure to salt water.\r\n\r\n[GardenCart.ca](http://GardenCart.ca) sells a number of the Fold-It Carts including Industrial Foldit Carts and accessories like the Bicycle Hitch Trailer Hitch, half-height and full-height rear gates.\r\n\r\n### Reels on Wheels by CPI Designs\r\nCPI Designs is an American manufacturing company that produces welded aluminum products for the sporting goods industry, including the Reels on Wheels brand fishing carts, Beagle & Bird dog boxes, and Easy Step folding ladders, as well as accessories.

', 'Post-secondary students are back in school this month and are pondering about the credits and deductions available on their tax bills ever since changes have been announced in the federal budget.  \r\n\r\nStudents pursuing their higher education can claim three tax credits that will help them bring down their tax bills. They can claim their tuition, education and textbook credits. Tuition credit is a non-refundable credit, it is worth around 15 percent of the amount of tuition fees and doesn’t have a maximum claim amount. Education amount is 15 percent on $400 for each month of full time education or $120 a month if the student is part time. Text book credits are also similar, they are only available to those who claim the education amount and is worth $9.75 a month for full time students and $3 a month for part time post-secondary students. \r\n\r\nIf the student doesn’t use the credit in a particular year due to lack of sufficient income to claim the credits, the student’s partner, spouse, parent or grandparents can claim it. If there is a remaining amount it can also be used by the student at a future time as a carry-forward credit. \r\n\r\nFrom January 1 education and text credits will be eliminated according to the budget statement. Tuition credit and the carry forward rules will apply have not yet claimed their previous credits that arose before 2017.\r\n\r\nInterest on student loans can be claimed as a non-refundable tax credit, however the interest must be paid by student and not by a parent or someone else. If a student has no tax payable, either because of sufficient credits to pay no tax at all or due to low income then they can carry forward the interest paid and claim it in the following five years. \r\n\r\nStudent loans have to be under the Canada Student Loans Act, the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act or a similar provincial or territorial government law to qualify for the credit.\r\n\r\nThe goods and services tax (GST) can benefit students as it is available to lower-income Canadians who are at least 19; this ensures Post-secondary students are eligible to avail it. A tax return must be filed if a student wishes to utilize this.\r\n \r\nFull time post-secondary students who move at least 40 kilometres to attend the program can also deduct any moving expenses from income earned from part time jobs. Moving for summer jobs is also eligible for deductions since a student who has moved at least 40 kilometers from school during the summer months can deduct the moving costs incurred.', 0, 10, 0, 0, 1, NULL, 'Think about the credits and deductions available to students on tax bills since changes were announced in the last federal budget.', 'Staff', '', '2016-10-11 02:38:10', '2016-10-11 02:38:10'),

', 'This year visitors to Vancouver and Toronto have a new way to see cities: Airbnb’s [Guidebooks](https://www.airbnb.ca/things-to-do/). In Canada they have [Vancouver](https://www.airbnb.ca/things-to-do/vancouver), [Toronto](https://www.airbnb.ca/things-to-do/toronto) and Montreal covered with several thousand places listed. This is part of a new strategy to get guests to live like locals and avoid the tourist pitfalls. Airbnb describes the guides as “passports” to places from locals (or other members who have visited the area). This does put Airbnb into competition with services like TripAdvisor and Yelp and it’s still unknown if members will be interested enough in the service to continue using Airbnb apps throughout their trips.\r\n\r\nWorldwide, the Guidebooks started with 3 million tips from 23 of the most popular cities on Airbnb: Austin, Bangkok, Barcelona, Berlin, Boston, Buenos Aires, Lake Tahoe, London, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Mexico City, Miami, New York, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, San Francisco, Seoul, Sydney, Tel Aviv, Tokyo, Venice and Washington, DC.\r\n\r\nRelated to this is the the neighbourhood feature works. It covers around 690 specific areas within 23 cities, the idea is to try to introduce visitors to more areas that they might not have considered.\r\n\r\n>>> ### “The number one reason people chose to travel on Airbnb is they want to live like a local. They don’t want to be tourists stuck in long lines, fighting with the crowds to see the same thing as everyone else,” <small>- Brian Chesky, Airbnb co-founder/CEO</small>\r\n\r\nAs well, as travelers look at individual listings, Airbnb’s machine learning models come up with additional places people might like that are similar, based on factors like room types, number of guests, price ranges, and number of times you visit a listing, to come up with additional places you might be interested in based on what you’re looking for. They say that with several months testing, they’ve seen a dramatic increase in successful bookings.\r\n\r\nThe technology behind this comes from Trip4Real, a company that Airbnb had partnered with for several years and acquired in September 2016. Trip4Real is a travel-focused startup from Barcelona whose business model was built on offering activities in cities around the world. Its slogan "experience a city like a local" sounds like the message Airbnb has been pushing for some time now. Trip4Real website promised visitors thousands of local experiences that were "made by locals" in cities around the world with the goal of helping travelers find things off the beaten path. This meshed with Airbnb’s vision to help travelers avoid cookie-cutter trips by including locally-sourced info about neighbourhoods, something that started to show up when it launched redesigned apps earlier this year. \r\n\r\nBack in October 2015, Airbnb started testing “Journeys” a way to pick a city and let the company book accommodations and pair that with meals, transportation and a local host to show you around town. This lead to apps like the short-lived Airbnb Trips app for Android, and work continues on integrating human expertise and machine-learning. \r\n\r\nAs well as this, Airbnb is exploring other ways to use local knowledge to combat potential problems, such as the new feedback tool that is coming out this year, it allows neighbours of Airbnb properties to comment on the behavior of guests, as a way of combating ''party houses''.\r\n\r\nFor your next visit to [Toronto](https://www.airbnb.ca/things-to-do/toronto) or [Vancouver](https://www.airbnb.ca/things-to-do/vancouver), consider checking out Airbnb’s new guidebooks, you might find some unexpected gems.', 0, 11, 20, 0, 1, NULL, 'This year visitors to Vancouver and Toronto have a new way to see the cities: Airbnb’s Guidebooks, part of a new strategy to get guests to live like locals and avoid the tourist pitfalls.', 'Staff', '', '2016-10-21 04:31:37', '2016-10-21 04:35:09');
